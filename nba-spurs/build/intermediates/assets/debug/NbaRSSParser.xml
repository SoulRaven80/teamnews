<description>Under the care of the Indiana Pacers' medical staff, Paul George has spent the past three days engaged in the NBA's Return-to-Participation Exertion Protocol as part of the NBA's Concussion Policy.   George remained symptom free after each step of the process.  The Pacers staff consulted with Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, the NBA's Director of Concussion Management, throughout George's progress through the protocol and today cleared him to return to normal basketball activity.   George will participate in tomorrow's shootaround and barring any unforeseen complications, he will play in Saturday's game at the Miami Heat. </description>
