      <description>With the NBA draft only two days away and Kevin Love there to be had for the right offer, Minnesota Timberwolves President Flip Saunders was asked if things are starting to get interesting.  ''They've been interesting for four weeks,'' Saunders said Tuesday.  Such is life for Saunders and the Timberwolves, who find themselves in a position of power as Thursday night's draft approaches.  He declined to discuss specific offers, but teams like Cleveland, Boston and Chicago could offer packages involving draft picks while Golden State is known to be involved with a package of established players.</description>

      <title>Here are the seven most likely destinations for LeBron James (NBC on Yahoo Sports)</title>
      <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/sports/rss/nba/SIG=151h4nog4/*http%3A//sports.yahoo.comhttps://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/NBA-nbc-on-yahoo-sports/here-are-the-seven-most-likely-destinations-for-lebron-james-161131616-nba.html</link>
      <description>
 LeBron James is opting out of his contract in part to put pressure on Pat Riley and the Miami Heat &#x2014; &#x201C;you need to upgrade this roster or else.&#x201D; 
 But that&#x2019;s the thing about a threat, you can&#x2019;t make it unless you are willing to follow through should the other side not back down. You have to mean the &#x201C;or else&#x201D; part. 
 Does LeBron really mean it? Starting July 1 he is a free agent 30 teams will make some kind of move to get him, but only a few have a real chance. Here are his top seven potential landing spots. 
 1) Miami Heat. They are still easily the leaders here. By a mile. He won two titles here and he has a level of trust with Pat Riley he never had in Cleveland. As mentioned above, LeBron was threatening Pat Riley to upgrade but there is another key thing LeBron knows &#x2014; Pat Riley couldn&#x2019;t upgrade unless he, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh all opted out and made a financial sacrifice. If all three opted in this season, along with Mario Chalmers , the Heat were already right at the salary cap number and Riley&#x2019;s hands would have been tied. 
 LeBron opted out early and how much he consulted with Wade and Bosh is not known (it is very likely he told them his plan however they have yet to have sit down meeting), but again the message to the other two members of the big three is clear &#x2014; this is LeBron&#x2019;s team, they don&#x2019;t win without him, and if they choose getting paid he can and will leave. 
 Expect them all to opt out and re-sign in Miami. For example, if LeBron and Bosh take $17-$18 million a year and Pat Riley can convince the aging Wade that he will get more money long term if he signs for four years, $48 million (he gets $7 million more guaranteed) then Riley would be roughly $9 million under the cap (counting place holders) and he could chase a couple quality free agents plus have his mid-level exception to spend. The Heat could bring in talent that would help. 
 But is Wade really going to do that? He is the wild card. 
 However the big three choose to work out the money, this remains by far the most likely scenario. 
 2) Chicago Bulls. If LeBron is going to leave he is in full legacy building mode now &#x2014; he needs rings. This is the best place to get them. The Bulls have chased the idea of Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Love as their power forward, LeBron is a big upgrade over either of those. This takes a lot of pressure off Derrick Rose to create all the offense, the Bulls defensive system would become shut down and they would be a threat to any team that came out of the West. LeBron would take a public relations hit (he will take one no matter where he goes other than Miami) and be accused of being in Jordan&#x2019;s shadow, but he could build a legacy there. 
 3) Houston Rockets. This is the same idea as Chicago &#x2014; they are trying to add a star and if you put LeBron James with James Harden and Dwight Howard you are the best team in the West on paper. There are a million hurdles with this one &#x2014; the Rockets have to dump Omer Asik and Jeremy Lin , and Chandler Parsons has to be allowed to walk, but if you can create space you have a big three. Now, this big three isn&#x2019;t as smooth &#x2014; it&#x2019;s hard for LeBron to drive the lane with Howard in it, plus Howard pouts when he doesn&#x2019;t get his touches &#x2014; and we can question if Kevin McHale is the coach who can make all the pieces fit, but this is an option. 
 4) Los Angeles Clippers. LeBron can pretty much force his way anywhere, if he so chooses. This would be him forcing an outcome on Pat Riley &#x2014; LeBron would love to play with Chris Paul and for Doc Rivers, but the Clippers do not have the cap space to sign him. This would have to be a sign-and-trade, Something like DeAndre Jordan and J.J. Redick for LeBron (there likely would be other pieces). If I&#x2019;m Riley, I push hard for Blake Griffin in that trade coming back. Would the Clippers do that &#x2014; Griffin is the fan favorite and the heart of the marketing program in Los Angeles. He gets announced last in pregame, not CP3. Griffin is not yet in his prime. But this is LeBron we&#x2019;re talking about. 
 5) Cleveland Cavaliers. We have moved from the &#x201C;unlikely&#x201D; to &#x201C;crazy long shot&#x201D; portion of the program. While a lot of fans think LeBron returning to Cleveland is the only non-Miami option, I think it would be a disaster. First, it is a half-hearted apology to return at this point. Next, this team is not ready to take on the best out of the West &#x2014; Kyrie Irving and the No. 1 pick and LeBron with Dion Waiters and Tristan Thompson get swept by the Spurs or the Thunder or the Clippers. If you&#x2019;re dreaming of Kevin Love and LeBron in Cleveland with Kyrie, I suggest you stop eating the &#x201C;special&#x201D; brownies. 
 6) Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers have the cap space and they have the best brand in basketball in a major market. They have whatever&#x2019;s left of Kobe Bryant . But they are in the Western Conference which means just to get back to the Finals the Lakers have to get past the Spurs, Thunder, Clippers, Grizzlies, Rockets, Warriors and Blazers. They could in theory get Carmelo Anthony and LeBron, but again that big three has to fight its way out of a brutal West. Long shot at best. 
 7) Atlanta Hawks/Phoenix Suns. LeBron is not going to go to these teams in these markets, but they would be fascinating. I love the Atlanta idea, they could have in the ballpark of $17 million if they trade Lou Williams and that would give the Hawks a starting five of Jeff Teague (better than any Miami point guard), Kyle Korver to space the floor, LeBron at the three, Paul Millsap at the four and Al Horford at the five. That&#x2019;s a good team. The Suns could sign Lebron to a near max and if you put him with Eric Bledsoe and shooters on a fast-paced teak it would be fun to watch. Probably not good enough to get out of the West, but fun. 
 ( What about the New York Knicks ? Good luck. Phil Jackson can dream but he can&#x2019;t make this happen. The Knicks don&#x2019;t have the cap room to sign him and Pat Riley isn&#x2019;t taking on some combination of Amare Stoudemire , Andrea Bargnani and Tyson Chandler to make this fit. Maybe LeBron and Anthony together is enough to get out of the East, but it&#x2019;s right back to the Miami situation of needing to find a way to build a team good enough to challenge the best of the West. It makes no sense for him to go to New York. But Phil will try.)

      <title>The 10-man rotation, starring what haunted Eddie Griffin (Ball Don't Lie)</title>
      <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/sports/rss/nba/SIG=14jaqqm42/*http%3A//sports.yahoo.comhttps://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/the-10-man-rotation--starring-what-haunted-eddie-griffin-235220574.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[A look around the league and the Web that covers it. It's also important to note that the rotation order and starting nods aren't always listed in order of importance. That's for you, dear reader, to figure out. 
 C : Grantland . Jonathan Abrams on the life and death of Eddie Griffin, the sweet-shooting big man who was the seventh pick of the 2001 NBA draft and whose all-around gifts marked him as a sky-is-the-limit prospect ("Watching Anthony Davis reminds me a lot of Eddie Griffin," a former teammate says), but whose inability to find the right fit on and off the court — mostly off it — turned a promising life story into a tragic cautionary tale. 
 PF : Knickerblogger . Robert Silverman reacts with appropriate insanity to the news, as reported by CBSSports.com's Ken Berger this weekend, that the New York Knicks paid the Toronto Raptors $1.4 million — in addition to Steve Novak, Marcus Camby, Quentin Richardson, a 2016 first-round draft pick and a 2017 second-round pick — in exchange for Andrea Bargnani last summer. I would've thought it impossible to make that trade look even worse , but then, these are the Knicks we're talking about. 
 SF : Boston Globe . Danny Ainge offers an insight — not necessarily a tell-all, but some details and some broad strokes — into what he and his colleagues in the Boston Celtics' front office look for when they approach the annual NBA draft, how they evaluate prospects and how they try to figure out what other teams are looking for when they see that their draft board came out different from those of their competitors. 
 SG :  The Triangle . Danny Chau on Australian guard Dante Exum, an international prospect who'd really prefer it if  you stopped calling him a man of mystery , and "a player talented enough to dredge up memories of the NBA draft’s dark age — a time of misplaced optimism, nonexistent due diligence, and crippling regret." (Here's some  interesting , albeit  branded-content-heavy , stuff on the performance training Exum's been working through in the run-up to the 2014 NBA draft.) 
 PG : Liberty Ballers . Derek Bodner goes in-depth on Michael Carter-Williams' janky jump shot, and explains why he's not especially confident that the reigning Rookie of the Year will develop into a smooth, consistent, knock-down shooter. 
 6th : Eye on Basketball . Matt Moore argues for Chris Bosh keeping his options open this summer, especially if LeBron James decides to leave the Miami Heat, because he's versatile enough to fit into virtually any team's plans and might want to avoid getting stuck in a declining situation in Florida: "Bosh is at risk of chaining himself to [Dwyane] Wade's anchor as he descends into irrelevance. Bosh's talent deserves better than to go down with the ship." 
 7th : The Buzzer . Dwight Howard treated some Houston Rockets fans to Laser Tag over the weekend, which is nice. 
 8th : JohnRambo on YouTube . Twelve minutes of the San Antonio Spurs absolutely carving up the Miami Heat defense in the 2014 NBA Finals. 
 9th : SB Nation . Mark Deeks on why Carmelo Anthony doesn't deserve blame if he leaves the Knicks in free agency , and why no player in his position merits scorn for turning down more money in pursuit of a better chance at winning a championship. 
 10th : Sports Illustrated . Jeremy Woo on a 2014 draft that could be a coming-out party for Canadian basketball, with as many as eight north-of-the-border prospects considered potential selections.

      <title>Anthony opts out of Knicks contract (AFP)</title>

      <description>Carmelo Anthony made it official on Monday, opting out of the final season of his New York Knicks contract in order to test the free agent market, his agent said.  "Carmelo loves being a Knick," Leon Rose said.  The impending move had been widely reported at the weekend, but the seven-time NBA All-Star had until Monday to exercise the early termination clause in his contract with the Knicks, who were due to pay him $64 million in the final season of the three-year extension he inked after being acquired from the Denver Nuggets in February of 2011.  As a free agent, Anthony can hear offers from other teams starting on July 1.</description>

      <title>Carmelo Anthony on his upcoming free agency: 'At the end of the day, you're creating a family' (Video) (Ball Don't Lie)</title>
      <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/sports/rss/nba/SIG=160gkttme/*http%3A//sports.yahoo.comhttps://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/carmelo-anthony-on-his-upcoming-free-agency---at-the-end-of-the-day--you-re-creating-a-family---video-202353984.html</link>
      <description>Carmelo Anthony has officially notified the New York Knicks that he will exercise the early termination option in his contract, forgoing the final year and $23.3 million on his current deal to become an unrestricted free agent come July 1. After a 37-45 Knicks season in which he missed the playoffs for the first time in his 11-year career, Anthony said he values winning more than making the largest possible salary at this stage. But what else will factor into the seven-time All-Star's first true foray into free agency? 
 The folks at VICE Sports sat down with Anthony to find out, and the results were pretty interesting: 
 
 For one thing, Anthony told VICE, how the decision impacts his family &#x2014; his wife, La La Vazquez, and their seven-year-old son, Kiyan &#x2014; ranks alongside on-court fit and championship contention when it comes to significant factors: 
 The average person just sees opportunity to say that, "Oh, 'Melo should go here, 'Melo should go there, I think he should do this, I think he should do that." But they don&#x2019;t take into consideration the family aspect of it &#x2014; your livelihood, where you're going to be living at. Do you want your kids to grow up in that place, in that city? Do I want to spend the rest of my career in that situation, in that city? So all of that stuff comes into play. 
 My son goes to school. He loves it here [in New York]. To take him out and take him somewhere else, he'd have to learn that system all over again. He'd have to get new friends, and I know how hard it was for me when I moved from New York to Baltimore at a young age &#x2014; like, having to work your way to try to make friends, and go actually try to make friends, and trying to fit in, and trying to figure out the culture in that area. As far as this goes &#x2014; like, basketball goes &#x2014; it&#x2019;s hard to just say, "OK, I&#x2019;m going to go here, I'm going to make this decision, I'm going to do that." Because everybody&#x2019;s affected by that. 
 And the average person is looking at it as next year, like it&#x2019;s just one year. &#x2018;Next year, you'll win a championship if you go here.&#x2019; We&#x2019;re looking at the big picture here, now. You're looking at the next six to eight years of your career &#x2014; the end of your career, at that. So do you want to spend that much time in that place? 
 Take that all together &#x2014; the fact that his family likes it in New York, that he's thinking less about next year (when the Knicks figure to be bad again, given extremely limited financial flexibility to augment their roster and few likely-to-improve assets on hand) and more about the next "six to eight years," etc. &#x2014; and if you're a Knicks fan, you might feel pretty good about your team's chances of retaining Anthony. His comments about moving from a smaller market to a larger one earlier in his career don't hurt, either: 
 I came from a smaller market, in Denver. Not so much scrutiny &#x2014; well, "scrutiny," there's tabloids and media everywhere, but not like the level of playing here in New York. Playing in a small market, you only could go so high as far as individual players go. You reach that max. There's only so much you can do at a point in your life that, you know, you've got to look for something else. A bigger stand, a bigger stage, a bigger market. 
 So when you go to places like New York, you're there, you're playing for two nights, and you feel the excitement. You feel the difference. The energy is different. The fans is different. The game is different, playing in New York. And then you go back home and you're like, "I want that." 
 There are valleys to go with those peaks, though, and after three years of having what he wanted &#x2014; the opportunity to play in one of the nation's biggest markets for one of the sport's most watched, covered and, yes, scrutinized teams &#x2014; Anthony has experienced the negative side of all that attention, especially when it comes to the Knickerbocker-obsessed fans who pack the stands at Madison Square Garden: 
 It's when you're here in New York, in the Garden, and you could be playing so well, and then you just have a breakdown throughout the course of the game. And then the boos will come. Now, that's when you're like, "What the hell is wrong with these people?" 
 (Speaking solely for myself &#x2014; I wouldn't want to speak for the rest of Knicks fandom &#x2014; I can only say, "Quite a bit, my man.") 
 Anthony also told VICE that he'd "love to be involved in" decisions on player personnel, "because at the end of the day, you're creating a family." (There's that word again.) It remains to be seen how much input Anthony would have on decision-making with any of his prospective suitors &#x2014; the Phil Jackson-run Knicks, the Gar Forman/John Paxson-led Chicago Bulls, the Daryl Morey-run Houston Rockets, etc. But after watching expected star-level running buddies like Amar'e Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler, and needed role-playing contributors like J.R. Smith, Raymond Felton and Iman Shumpert unable at different junctures to do their share for the Knicks, you could understand Anthony wanting to know that the guys with whom he's sharing the locker room are going to be able to handle their business. 
 "You can't create a bond with somebody that's not going to fit in with you or not going to be there when you need them the most, and don't understand the game and how to win, and situations in the game, and things like that," he said. "As much as it has to do with having the top guys on the team &#x2014; superstars, per se &#x2014; you need the rest of your soldiers. You need the guys that's going to go to out there and put their life on the line for you, because it's a war. It's a battle." 
 In the broader battle for the All-Star forward, the teams vying for Anthony's services now have at least some sense of the terms of engagement: big market, comfortable transition/living conditions for his family, and a roster of guys he believes can help make the NBA Finals for the first time in his career. Let's see who can make the most compelling case for one of the NBA's most dangerous offensive weapons.

      <title>Carmelo Anthony makes it official, opting out of final year of contract with Knicks to test free agency (Ball Don't Lie)</title>
      <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/sports/rss/nba/SIG=1621so80v/*http%3A//sports.yahoo.comhttps://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/carmelo-anthony-makes-it-official--opting-out-of-final-year-of-contract-with-knicks-to-test-free-agency-174749504.html</link>
      <description>We've known this was coming since at least October , but now it's official. As Yahoo Sports NBA columnist Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Sunday, Carmelo Anthony has officially notified the New York Knicks that he is exercising the early termination option in his contract, and will become an unrestricted free agent as of the beginning of free agency on July 1. 
 Anthony's agent, Leon Rose, confirmed his client's decision &#x2014; which the 30-year-old All-Star forward communicated to the Knicks in a "formal letter" on Friday, according to Chris Herring of the Wall Street Journal &#x2014; in a statement to reporters on Monday morning. From Steve Popper of the Bergen, N.J., Record: 
 From Camelo's agent, Leon Rose - confirms opt out and issues a statement. ... &#x2014; Steve Popper (@StevePopper) June 23, 2014 
 "Carmelo loves being a Knick. He loves the city and the fans. At this stage of his career he just wants to explore his options." &#x2014; Steve Popper (@StevePopper) June 23, 2014 
 And that's what Carmelo has said since last summer. So...yeah. &#x2014; Steve Popper (@StevePopper) June 23, 2014 
 By exercising his ETO, Anthony's forfeiting the chance to make $23,333,405 next season, but he's doing so knowing that A) he's a sure bet to receive far more lucrative multi-year offers from multiple suitors and B) playing the field affords him the option of possibly moving to a more attractive short-term title-contending environment than the one in New York. 
 The Knicks are coming off a disappointing 37-45 season in which they failed to make the playoffs (the first postseason miss of Anthony's 11-year career) in a very bad Eastern Conference. They're replacing their fired head coach with a first-timer who was in uniform this time last month. They've got a first-time personnel boss tasked with building a contender on the fly despite being totally capped out and over the luxury tax for 2014-15 , having very little flexibility to add free-agent talent, having no picks in the 2014 and 2016 NBA drafts and being unable to trade their 2015 first-round pick due to league rules. It's not the most enticing setting at the moment. 
 Phil Jackson and the Knicks' brass had publicly and privately tried to sell Anthony on opting not to exercise the ETO, sticking around to collect his $23.3 million, opening the door to a higher prospective maximum salary , and allowing the Knicks to enter the summer of 2014-15 with Anthony in tow and enough financial flexibility (after the expiration of eight-figure contracts owed to Amar'e Stoudemire, Tyson Chandler and Andrea Bargnani) to be able to make competitive offers to other top-flight free-agent talent. Anthony &#x2014; who said in November that he wanted to retire in New York , but still has a lot of basketball in front of him before he gets to that point &#x2014; apparently did not bite on Jackson's and Fisher's vision of the future. 
 That doesn't necessarily mean that Anthony's played his last game as a Knick. New York still holds Anthony's Bird rights and, despite being well over the salary cap and luxury-tax line, can both go even further into the red to re-sign him and offer him a longer, more lucrative contract than anyone else, a five-year deal worth a maximum $129 million. The most another suitor could offer him would be a four-year deal worth approximately $96 million. That said, though, some feel that Anthony &#x2014; who said in his season-wrapping press conference that &#x201C;without a doubt, at this point in my career it&#x2019;s about winning" &#x2014; might not necessarily go for the top dollar here. 
 "If he makes the choice to opt out, I think he's gone," a "person familiar with the matter" told Herring of the Journal . 
 This, of course, begs the question: gone where? Wojnarowski reports that Anthony "will closely examine opportunities" with both the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets. 
 The Bulls have Defensive Player of the Year Joakim Noah at center, a reportedly ready-to-go former MVP Derrick Rose coming back on offense, and an excellent head coach in Tom Thibodeau &#x2014; with whom Anthony's agent has "been close friends for nearly two decades," according to Frank Isola of the New York Daily News &#x2014; who is reportedly pushing for Chicago to bring Anthony's scoring prowess into the fold. The Bulls' collection of movable draft picks and players "could [give them] the inside track if the Knicks' superstar decides he wants to move on," according to CBSSports.com's Ken Berger ; the Knicks "are expected to explore sign-and-trade possibilities, especially with the Bulls, who have several non-guaranteed contracts that could make it viable" according to Scott Cacciola of the New York Times . 
 The Rockets &#x2014; Oscar Robertson's preferred 'Melo destination , for what it's worth &#x2014; would provide Anthony the opportunity to a near-contention core featuring the All-Star inside-out combination of Dwight Howard and James Harden, restricted free agent swingman Chandler Parsons and defensive-minded point guard Patrick Beverley. Houston would need to move a pair of high-priced reserves, former Bulls center Omer Asik and ex-Knicks guard Jeremy Lin, to create enough cap space to offer Anthony a contract approaching his full max contract. The Rockets "have long been confident that they could move Asik and Lin if necessary to create cap space because unlike their efforts to deal Asik during the season, they would not be seeking comparable talent in return," according to Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle . 
 Reports circulated earlier this month that the Miami Heat were considering free-agent plans that included having top stars LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh exercise their own early termination options this summer and, along with Anthony, take pay cuts to enable the creation of a "Big Four" in Florida . James, Wade and Bosh all downplayed that chatter , and Heat team president Pat Riley called it "a pipe dream" (before noting, of course, that the creation of the Big Three in 2010 was considered a pipe dream, too). 
 The Dallas Mavericks have also been a rumored potential landing spot for Anthony, but while Dallas star Dirk Nowitzki said the Mavericks would "love to have him," he also acknowledged that he doesn't think it's realistic to think that Anthony will head to Texas. The Los Angeles Lakers, fresh off their own dismal season and firing of a head coach with whom Anthony didn't exactly get along in Manhattan, have loads of cap space , a reportedly 100 percent Kobe Bryant and the No. 7 pick in Thursday's 2014 NBA draft, but very little else; before the season, Anthony called it doubtful that he'd find himself in forum blue and gold come next year. 
 Just how viable any of these (or other) potential landing spots are remains to be seen. For now, all we know is that Anthony is indeed opting out and that he's indeed interested in experiencing full-fledged, unfettered free agency for the first time in his NBA career. 
 Which is to say, we know today exactly what we knew eight months ago.

      <title>NBA: Anthony opts out of Knicks contract, to become free agent (Reuters)</title>
      <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/sports/rss/nba/SIG=13vepuble/*http%3A//sports.yahoo.comhttps://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba-anthony-opts-knicks-contract-become-free-agent-171059230--nba.html</link>
      <description>(Reuters) - Carmelo Anthony&#xA0;officially opted out of the final year of his contract with the&#xA0;New York Knicks&#xA0;on Monday and will test free agency this offseason, ESPN reported.  The high-scoring forward's agent confirmed Anthony's widely expected decision to forego the $23.5 million he would have made for the final year of his contract with the Knicks in order to explore his options.  "At this stage of his career, he just wants to explore his options."  The move by Anthony, who averaged 27.4 points and a career-high 8.1 rebounds for the Knicks last season, does not guarantee his exit from New York, as team president Phil Jackson could offer him more than anyone else to keep him on the club.  The Knicks could offer the former NBA scoring champion a maximum contract worth $129 million over five years.</description>

      <description>As expected, New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony will opt out of his contract and become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. Instead, he will test the free-agent market and could land with the Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks or Miami Heat. Anthony has been doing research on the city of Chicago, according to ESPNNewYork.com. Anthony has reportedly spoken to at least one high-profile person who lives in Chicago about what it is like to be famous there.</description>

      <description>Top prospect Joel Embiid had surgery on the stress fracture in his right foot Friday, and now he waits.  He waits to see how far he falls in the NBA draft Thursday night.  He waits to see how he responds to an injury that has a history of giving NBA big men problems.  The Kansas center, who was in the running to be taken No. 1 overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers, had two screws inserted into the navicular bone in his right foot at Southern California Orthopedic Institute, according to a release distributed by agent Arn Tellem.</description>

      <title>A separation between Carmelo Anthony and the New York Knicks might be the best for both sides (Ball Don't Lie)</title>
      <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/sports/rss/nba/SIG=15ov6b4lm/*http%3A//sports.yahoo.comhttps://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/a-separation-between-carmelo-anthony-and-the-new-york-knicks-might-be-the-best-for-both-sides-221911842.html</link>
      <description>It&#x2019;s looking more and more like Phil Jackson and Carmelo Anthony have an understanding. 
 They like each other. They respect each other. They would both truly like to see a Carmelo Anthony-led New York Knicks team working well within the championship picture. Both sides know Anthony, in his prime, is very much worth the maximum contract money he&#x2019;ll make over the next two seasons. 
 It&#x2019;s the seasons beyond that, though, that become tricky. And it&#x2019;s that 2014-15 season, with the Knicks patiently awaiting the expiration of Amar&#x2019;e Stoudemire ($23.4 million next season, wow), Tyson Chandler (nearly $14.6 million, yikes), and Andrea Bargnani&#x2019;s ($11.5 million in 2014-15, for shame) contracts. Jackson can sell Carmelo on the idea that in the summer of 2015 he&#x2019;ll be working in the greatest city in the world with four years and more than $100 million left on his deal and (FINALLY!) cap space to add teammates, but that would involve Anthony working in purgatory once again during 2014-15, possibly missing the playoffs for just the second time in his career. 
 And, the probable truth is, Jackson doesn&#x2019;t really know if he wants to submit to that sort of plan himself. To pay Anthony an ungodly amount of money until he&#x2019;s 35, to rebuild with a 31-year-old Anthony, with no assurances of adding a bevy of free agent helpers, in 2015. 
 We don&#x2019;t blame either side. And it&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re hearing more and more about Anthony working in concert with New York to get what he wants &#x2013; a better team for 2014-15 and as much money as legally possible. 
 Chicago, Houston, Miami and others think they have enough to ham-and-egg things and offer Anthony just enough of both sides &#x2013; great teammates, cool cash, hot treats and sweet summertime deals &#x2013; to finagle a working scenario. This only begins with Carmelo and New York coming to an understanding. And soon. 
 Anthony has to decide whether or not to exercise the early termination option on his contract for next season, one that would pay him more than $23.3 million next year in the final year of his deal. He could re-sign with New York for the full maximum, making nearly $22.5 million next season and more than $29 million in 2018-19. 
 Jackson may not want him on those terms, especially as Anthony enters his 30s. It&#x2019;s more than understandable. The new Knicks president just hired a rookie coach in Derek Fisher who is taking to his title just days after his playing career ended. New York is working with limited draft options over the next few years because of a series of pound-foolish moves, and no team is going to aid in the Knicks&#x2019; recovery and take Stoudemire or Bargnani or probably even Chandler (unless a contending squad really goes all-in) off their hands. An older personnel boss like Jackson likely wants to win now at any cost, but even he can see this is not going to be a short-term fix. 
 Anthony probably feels the same way. 
 Chicago intrigues because it would seemingly be the best fit for Anthony&#x2019;s talents, and the Bulls remain a team that could either work up a passable deal for Anthony in tandem with the Knicks or blast its way toward enough cap space to sign Anthony outright. Even the best option, though, is not without its nags. 
 The Bulls owned the third-worst offense in the NBA last season, and even with Derrick Rose&#x2019;s return the team still badly needs what Anthony does best. If it could come to a wink-wink agreement with New York regarding its 16th and 19th overall draft picks in the upcoming draft (Anthony cannot be traded on draft night), it could possibly deal Carlos Boozer and a small cadre of unguaranteed contracts (Mike James, et cetera) for Anthony in a sign and trade. Boozer&#x2019;s $16.8 million deal expires in 2015, but for New York that&#x2019;s an awful lot to play for a player you don&#x2019;t need, just to grab two middling first-round picks. Even dealing for Taj Gibson, a sterling performer currently working in his prime, doesn&#x2019;t really do much for a Knicks team still years away from contention. 
 The more likely scenario involves the long-held suspicion that Chicago would use the amnesty provision on Boozer&#x2019;s contract, which would immediately clear up $13 million in cap space for Chicago. That&#x2019;s a starting salary that would represent a massive pay cut for Anthony, who could make nearly $130 million in total on his deal in New York if Jackson decides to hand him the max. Chicago could use one of those draft picks on a player it can stash overseas and possibly deal veteran swingman Mike Dunleavy Jr. to a team with cap space (or for a trade exception) for just about nothing in return, and clear up more space to toss Anthony&#x2019;s way in hopes of signing him. 
 Each of these moves, though, harms an already skinflint Bulls roster. The team can&#x2019;t expect to deal Gibson, whose presence is solely needed in any scenario, and a cheap date like Dunleavy can&#x2019;t be treated as mere fodder to toss off. Anthony is not the obvious and complete answer for Chicago, and damaging an already shaky roster in hopes of sending him more and more money is a risky proposition. Even if Anthony wants to give up cash in order to win. 
 Houston&#x2019;s chances are less viable, as they&#x2019;ve already cashed in years' worth of collected assets on both James Harden and Dwight Howard, though there is a solid chance Rockets general manager Daryl Morey could still make it work. If Morey can find a desperate team with cap space and unload reserves Omer Asik and Jeremy Lin, there will be space available once the team declines its laughably miniscule option on Chandler Parsons &#x2013; who would then have to go offer his talents on the restricted free-agent market, a daring calculation in what figures to be a player-friendly market. Houston will match any offer, of course, but some other team will make them pay. 
 The Lakers? They&#x2019;ll have room and a lottery pick, but in spite of Kobe Bryant&#x2019;s returning presence this is hardly a &#x201C;win-now&#x201D; scenario. Miami, just a few weeks removed from having the home-court advantage with five future NBA Finals games left to play after taking Game 2 against San Antonio, will always rank as a &#x201C;win-now&#x201D; setup. It&#x2019;ll take some real conniving, and for each of the team&#x2019;s stars to take far less money, in order to bring in a player in Anthony doesn&#x2019;t really suit Miami&#x2019;s needs (outside shooting, defense at all positions) at this point. Still, one should never count out a cornered Pat Riley. 
 In any scenario, Anthony would be giving up money in order to play for a winner. Even if some team miraculously finds a way to offer Carmelo the max for next season, he&#x2019;ll still be leaving more than $33 million on the table. 
 That&#x2019;s presuming, of course, that Jackson wants to offer Anthony the full amount. Or that James Dolan, fearful of status as always, overrides his new basketball el jefe and gives his beloved Carmelo as much as Carmelo can possibly earn. 
 And, again, that&#x2019;s also presuming Carmelo wants to earn as much as he could possibly earn, and stay with a New York Knicks team that is no assured winner even in the leaky East. 
 The deadline is approaching, and both sides might be coming toward an understanding. Should Anthony and the Knicks decide to amicably part, though, will other squads have the assets and/or space to make a move feasible? And even then, will Carmelo be joining a surefire championship contender after all the pieces have been moved. 
 It&#x2019;s a tricky setup, and these factions only have a few weeks to figure out the next few years of their franchise&#x2019;s plan.

      <description>Kansas center Joel Embiid is scheduled to have surgery Friday to repair a stress fracture in his right foot, a stunning development that could affect the top choices in next week's NBA draft.  Embiid, one of the top three candidates the Cleveland Cavaliers were considering for the No. 1 overall pick, fractured the navicular bone in his right foot, agent Arn Tellem said Thursday.  Embiid will be unable to participate in any additional workouts and will not attend the draft in New York.  Prior to the injury, Embiid was widely considered to be the front-runner to be taken by the Cavaliers.</description>

"Oh yeah, I'm 100 percent," Bryant said when asked by the interviewer about his health.  --- What Dwight Howard wants and what Houston needs might be one and the same.</description>

      <title>The 10-man rotation, starring the Zach Randolph question staring down the Memphis Grizzlies (Ball Don't Lie)</title>
      <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/sports/rss/nba/SIG=15m9rmt34/*http%3A//sports.yahoo.comhttps://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/the-10-man-rotation--starring-the-zach-randolph-question-staring-down-the-memphis-grizzlies-230000813.html</link>
      <description>A look around the league and the Web that covers it. It's also important to note that the rotation order and starting nods aren't always listed in order of importance. That's for you, dear reader, to figure out. 
 C : Beyond the Arc . Our own Adrian Wojnarowski reported last month that bruising big man Zach Randolph is focused on re-signing with the Memphis Grizzlies this offseason. Kevin Lipe wonders: What's Z-Bo worth to Memphis at age 33, what's he going to be worth at 35, and how should the Grizz weigh those two evaluations when making their call should he opt out this summer? 
 PF : The Point Forward . A fun photo essay by Ben Golliver capturing 40 days and nights spent covering the world champion San Antonio Spurs. 
 SF : The Triangle . Andrew Sharp about how Internet discussions of LeBron James' strengths and weaknesses can be exhausting, no matter which way you feel about him. Possible alternate title: "Gotta Hear No Sides." 
 SG : Boston Globe . Baxter Holmes sets about dispelling the mystery surrounding possible top-five draft pick Dante Exum by talking to scads of scouts and front-office types &#x2026; and comes away with perhaps even less of a consensus on the Australian guard than there was going in. (As good as this is, it's not the best thing Baxter wrote this week .) 
 PG : Raptors Republic . Zarar Siddiqi takes a deep breath and considers the possibility of point guard Kyle Lowry leaving the Toronto Raptors in free agency, "a horrifying prospect because any version of a near-term outlook for a fan involves Lowry, the unquestionable leader of last season, being front-and-center." 
 6th : Grantland . Zach Lowe imagines a world without maximum player salaries. Would LeBron James get $40 million a year (or maybe even more)? What would happen to the NBA's comparatively vast middle class? How would teams' roster-building strategies change, and who would benefit most? 
 7th : Sports Illustrated . Speaking of max contracts: Just how much would Carmelo Anthony actually be leaving on the table in terms of take-home pay if he decided to leave the New York Knicks for the Chicago Bulls, Miami Heat or Houston Rockets, when you factor in taxes?

      <title>Howard: Rockets need third star (The SportsXchange)</title>

      <description>What Dwight Howard wants and what Houston needs might be one and the same.  That will not make the complicated task any easier to complete for the Rockets.  Creative-thinking and proactive general manager Daryl Morey lured Howard, the biggest catch in free agency last summer, to Houston with the intention of getting another star to join the Rockets this summer.  James Harden and Howard combine to make Houston a contender for the playoffs, but Howard thinks a championship can be attainable if the Rockets are able to maneuver their finances to clear room for one more elite player.</description>

      <title>After Game 5 loss, Shane Battier confirms he's retiring: 'I don't have any more to give' (Ball Don't Lie)</title>
      <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/sports/rss/nba/SIG=15vjjlihh/*http%3A//sports.yahoo.comhttps://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/after-game-5-loss--shane-battier-confirms-he-s-retiring-from-the-nba---i-don-t-have-any-more-to-give-190558403.html</link>
      <description>This time last year, Shane Battier was hammering a Grand Slam to celebrate a back-from-the-dead 18-point explosion that helped the Miami Heat complete a comeback for the ages, ward off the San Antonio Spurs and become back-to-back NBA champions. After going scoreless in Sunday's Game 5 loss to the resurrected Spurs, though, Battier was celebrating something very different than repeat titles: the end of a long race well run. 
 The 35-year-old forward, who has long said he was thinking about hanging 'em up when his contract ran out at the end of this season, confirmed in the Heat locker room on Sunday that he is retiring after a 13-year NBA career. 
 "I've given everything I can to the game and I don't have any more to give," Battier said after logging 11 minutes with one steal, one turnover and one last tangle in the paint (with Spurs guard Manu Ginobili), according to Dave Hyde of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel . "And I'm OK with it." 
 Battier echoed that sentiment in a farewell tweet on Monday afternoon: 
 Thank you thank you thank you thank you for all of the messages. It is an amazing feeling to be appreciated. It was a hell of a run and I have zero regrets. Proud that so many could feel a part of this journey, I appreciate your encouragement, love, and support. Cheers to all my friends on twitter! 
 Battier, who will now join ESPN as a college basketball analyst , ends a 13-year career that began with the then-Vancouver Grizzlies, who made him the No. 6 selection in the 2001 NBA draft, the franchise's final draft before moving to Memphis. Coming off a distinguished four-year stay in Durham, Battier stepped right into the starting small forward slot for head coach Sidney Lowe, averaging 14.4 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.6 steals per game for a very bad Grizzlies squad. All wound up being career highs; from a counting-stats perspective, it would be all downhill from there for Shane-O. 
 As Battier's numbers dropped, though, his impact as a defender and floor-spacer began to increase for Grizzlies teams that started to prosper thanks to the development of rising star big man Pau Gasol and the tutelage of eventual head coaches Hubie Brown and Mike Fratello. Battier was part of three postseason runs in Memphis, all of which ended in first-round sweeps, before being shipped to the Houston Rockets in the summer of 2006 in exchange for highly touted draft pick Rudy Gay and ex-Grizzly Stromile Swift. 
 Young Houston general manager Daryl Morey &#x2014; a Northwestern- and MIT-educated exec with a background in computer science, statistical analysis and strategic consulting tapped by owner Leslie Alexander to revamp the Rockets' approach &#x2014; looked at Battier as an undervalued commodity, a player whose contributions never seemed to pop out of the box score, but who often seemed to have success defending top wing scorers like Kobe Bryant and whose teams always seemed to perform better when he was on the floor. 
 Morey's thought process behind the Battier move, and a glimpse at the advanced statistics underpinning the argument that a guy who rarely topped 10 points a game could be considered a linchpin on a playoff team, became the basis for a February 2009 New York Times Magazine piece by star author Michael Lewis. The lengthy feature heralded the rise of the sort of basketball analysis that would eventually become its own industry through events like the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference , and rebranded Battier as "The No-Stats All-Star." 
 After 4 1/2 years and three more playoff trips in Houston &#x2014; including his first trip beyond Round 1, ending in a seven-game second-round defeat at the hands of Bryant, former teammate Gasol and the eventual NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers &#x2014; Battier found himself on the move again. He was sent back to Memphis at the 2011 trade deadline to help fortify a grind-it-out Grizzlies roster built around the interior heft of Zach Randolph and Pau's little (well, "little") brother Marc Gasol; the wing scoring of Gay, the player for whom he'd been traded back in 2006; and the odd-couple backcourt of Tony Allen and Mike Conley. Battier played his part as a defensive hound and gap-filler in the eighth-seeded Grizzlies' historic first-round upset of the No. 1 seed San Antonio Spurs before struggling in Memphis' second-round loss to Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and the young upstart Oklahoma City Thunder. 
 After another tough seven-game second-round defeat, Battier hit free agency and decided to move southeast to join up with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat. He proved to be a hand-in-glove fit for a Heat team in need of offensive and defensive redefinition, serving as a capable wing defender, consummate glue guy and reliable floor-spacer, especially from the corners. He helped give head coach Erik Spoelstra the flexibility to turn Miami's offensive scheme from a traditional two-big set in which James and Wade largely took turns facilitating offense into a streamlined, small-ball attack in which Bosh would serve as a nightmare matchup five, Battier would play the stretch four, and James and Wade would have much more room to attack the basket and set things up for themselves and one another. By playing that small four spot, Battier also helped save James the exhausting physical beating of having to handle big power forwards on the defensive end, helping keep Miami's top gun in fine form for long postseason runs. 
 The restructuring worked beautifully, as the Heat became the first team since the 2008-09 and '09-'10 Lakers to win consecutive championships, and the first since the mid-1980s Boston Celtics to make four straight trips to the NBA Finals. That fourth trip ended, though, as the first trip did, back in 2011 &#x2014; with a disappointing defeat owed in large part to an inability to stop a rampaging Texan offense from scoring, and with perhaps even more questions than answers heading into the postseason. From Bleacher Report's Ethan Skolnick : 
 "It was a difficult year," Shane Battier said after his final NBA game, repeating a sentiment he'd privately expressed several times during the season. "It was a trying year from the standpoint that there were very few pure moments. That was the biggest difference between the past two years. 
 "And we were always trying to conjure something. And for a while there, in the second half, it worked. But you can't win a championship trying to conjure something. It has to be who you are, and it has to be pure, and that wasn't the case for us this year." 
 Battier was speaking collectively, but it's easy to see the personal and specific in there, too. As this season wore on, though, the veteran could no longer conjure the capacity to fill the role Spoelstra set forth for him two summers earlier. It became evident that the burden of punching above his weight class against the David Wests of the world for the last three years had driven Battier into the ground. He shot a career-low 38.2 percent from the floor, his 3-point accuracy dropped more than 8 percent from a year ago, and he routinely struggled to provide the same sort of defensive productivity that we'd been accustomed to seeing from him. He was excised from Miami's rotation in an opening-round sweep of the Charlotte Bobcats; reintroduced in a starting, albeit, limited role with some success against the Brooklyn Nets; curbed to just 12.3 minutes per game in defeating the Indiana Pacers; and mostly mothballed in the five-game beating at the hands of the Spurs, capping things off with 11 undistinguished minutes in the Game 5 blowout. The end of the line had arrived. 
 "My goals when I started this whole crazy thing, they weren't to win championships or make the All-Defensive team," Battier said during a recent interview with Tim Reynolds of The Associated Press . "It was to play 10 years and to be able to walk away from the game before the game kicked me out." 
 He managed three more years than he'd bargained for, earning more than $56 million in salary and coming away with a pair of rings in the process. Not a bad deal. 
 As he leaves the league, Battier stands as one of 30 players in league history with at least 8,000 points, 4,000 rebounds, 900 blocks and 900 steals, a list that includes nine Hall of Famers (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, David Robinson, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Robert Parish, Patrick Ewing, Scottie Pippen, Julius Erving), three active players who will waltz into Springfield when their careers end (Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki), and several other interesting potential Hall cases (including Shawn Marion and Chris Webber). Factor in long-range proficiency &#x2014; say, guys who made at least 500 long balls in their careers &#x2014; and the list gets winnowed down to seven: Dirk, Pippen, Marion, Clifford Robinson, Rasheed Wallace, Sam Perkins ... and Battier. 
 Now, that's not to say that Battier's a Hall of Famer. Only 26 players who have played in the NBA and scored less than 9,000 points have been inducted into the Hall. Eighteen completed their careers before 1970. Three had legendary international careers (Drazen Petrovic, Sarunas Marciulionis, Arvydas Sabonis). Two boasted remarkable ABA accomplishments (Connie Hawkins, Mel Daniels). Two had their curtailed NBA careers augmented by their dominance in the NCAA ranks (Bill Walton, Ralph Sampson). One was, pound-for-pound, arguably the greatest rebounder and defender ever (Dennis Rodman). 
 Battier (8,408 career points) played in the modern era and doesn't have an especially remarkable international r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;, having been part of not-exactly-Dream Team, non-Olympic U.S. men's national squads that won gold at the 2001 Goodwill Games and bronze at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. He had a strong four years at Duke, earning two All-American berths and winning the 2001 national championship while sweeping the major National Player of the Year awards that year, but was nowhere near the game-changing force that Walton was at UCLA or that Sampson was at Virginia. And while Battier made his bones in the NBA as a tough, smart, versatile defender, twice earning recognition on the NBA's All-Defensive Second Team, he wasn't Rodman, or anything resembling Rodman. 
 Again: I share that list not to argue for Battier's Hall of Fame candidacy, but rather to note that, while we tend to think of him as an orthodox, conventional, square-back-and-sides type, the sum total of his career output marks him as something of a weird NBA player. 
 Dirk, Uncle Cliff, 'Sheed, Big Smooth, the Matrix, Andrei Kirilenko, Josh Smith, KG, Vlade Divac, Dr. J, Shawn Kemp, Marcus Camby ... there are a lot of guys on that list whose NBA games featured an odd confluence of skills and, in many cases, offbeat personalities to match. We don't necessarily think of Battier in that same light, what with all the "getting headhunted by campaign operatives " and "aggressively seeking out watery beer ," but he's certainly possessed of plenty of his own peccadilloes &#x2014; Battioke , anyone ? 
 He might've been a no-stats dude with a lack of swag to match, but in his own ways &#x2014; the possession-shifting, the option-creating, the gem-of-a-quote-dropping ways &#x2014; Battier still found ways to let his personal brand of freak flag fly. The league will be a little less interesting without his boring brand of weird in it. Vaya con dios, Shane.

      <description>Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki told a Dallas radio station that he hopes the team goes after New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony, who reportedly intends to become a free agent July 1.  "If Carmelo would really love to come here, we'd love to have him," Nowitzki told 105.3 The Fan.  The Knicks want to keep him but he plans to opt out of his deal, according to reports.  The Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets are listed in reports as the top candidates to land Anthony, but the Mavericks could be a possible destination for him.</description>

      <description>SAN ANTONIO -- They never felt obligated to explain themselves in great detail, the San Antonio Spurs' coach and the best player in franchise history.  However, Gregg Popovich and forward Tim Duncan were pretty clear about something the last few days.  Neither is ready to retire, which makes the Spurs a good bet to successfully defend the NBA championship they secured Sunday night with a 104-87 victory over the Miami Heat.  Popovich and Duncan won their fifth championship together, again earning the Spurs the respect and admiration of their peers.</description>

      <title>San Antonio downs the Miami Heat in Game 5, wins the 2013-14 NBA championship (Ball Don't Lie)</title>
      <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/sports/rss/nba/SIG=158jnqpn1/*http%3A//sports.yahoo.comhttps://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/san-antonio-downs-the-miami-heat-in-game-5--wins-the-2013-14-nba-championship-030041855.html</link>
      <description>
 The San Antonio Spurs should have been able to see it coming a mile away. The Miami Heat had three days to grit their teeth and prepare to keep their championship dreams alive after a Game 4 loss, with Chris Bosh more or less predicting a win , LeBron James imploring his teammates to follow his lead, and the Heat&#x2019;s collective backs against the figurative wall. For the first quarter, at least, it looked like the obvious storyline would play out: LeBron managed 17 first-quarter points , and the Heat were up 22-6 at one point and finished the first frame up 29-22, the team&#x2019;s first advantage at the end of the first quarter in five Finals tries. 
 Then, the Spurs started passing again. They started taking chances offensively and backing off the Heat&#x2019;s poor spacing on the other end. The script completely flipped, and before Miami knew it, the defending champs were down 20 points on the road, that impressive 16-point advantage a distant memory. Shot after shot went in, James&#x2019; teammates failed to step in to help their two-time Finals MVP, and by the time the confetti settled, the Spurs had taken Game 5 by a 104-87 score and won the 2013-14 NBA championship while utilizing some of the most impressive team play this league has seen since, well, the last time the Spurs won the title. 
 Or the time before that. Or the two times prior to that. Five times total, since Gregg Popovich and Tim Duncan joined forces in San Antonio just prior to the 1997-98 season. One month into that season, after his Houston Rockets took on Duncan&#x2019;s Spurs, Charles Barkley exclaimed to reporters that he had &#x201C;seen the future,&#x201D; and that it wore Duncan&#x2019;s uniform number. Charles couldn&#x2019;t have possibly been talking about June 2014 when making such an apt declaration. 
 Duncan scored 14 points, added eight boards with two blocks, and offered his usual expert help defense in the win, finishing the series with averages of 15.4 points and 10 rebounds, all while looking like the sort of player that could do this all over again in June o2015. San Antonio overcame a miserable shooting night from former Finals MVP Tony Parker, who shot 7-of-18 on his way to 16 points (missing his first 10 from the field) in the win as James continually went underneath the screens set for Parker, daring him to shoot. 
 Shoot he did, missing quite a few along the way, but Miami&#x2019;s defensive maneuver allowed the Spurs to start their possessions far closer to the basket than usual, and eventually the poor spacing caught up to Miami. Manu Ginobili keyed a first half surge and finished with 19 points and four assists, while Patty Mills came off the same Spurs bench to toss in a blistering 17 points while making 5-of-8 three-pointers. Miami was unable to counter on the other end, going long stretches without scoring, completely incapable of setting up anything offensively that didn&#x2019;t heavily rely on James doing all the damage individually. 
 
 Of course, it didn&#x2019;t hurt for San Antonio that James was once again closely watched by Kawhi Leonard. 
 To spy Leonard&#x2019;s play and body language early on, it was apparent that he was going to have to be the star-in-waiting to aid San Antonio in its comeback. While his veteran teammates appeared a little shook and unsure at the initial Miami onslaught, Leonard still moved with and without the ball offensively, while making a series of intelligent moves on the other end even as James racked up the points. He was unflappable despite the early deficit, and as the Heat settled down, Leonard&#x2019;s active play eventually began to offer some tangible results. 
 The third year swingman finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds, staying strong in the second half as well, giving the Spurs the sort of all-around demon that Miami&#x2019;s older legs just couldn&#x2019;t counter. It was obvious, even with the Spurs down double digit points early, that this was going to be Leonard&#x2019;s night. 
 He didn&#x2019;t completely shut James down, no one ever could, as LeBron ended his 2013-14 season with a 31-point, 10-rebound, five-assists and two-block line. Leonard earned that Finals MVP trophy, though, especially on a night where other potential candidates (Tony Parker in particular) struggled so mightily out of the gate. 
 The questions surrounding Miami&#x2019;s future &#x2013; James, Bosh and Dwyane Wade can all become free agents next month if they choose that route &#x2013; are for another day. Wade is clearly in decline, Bosh still struggles to find a fit in Miami&#x2019;s offense, and LeBron James looked absolutely fatigued down the stretch of the deciding Game 5. This outfit may not take in the litany of championships that James once half-jokingly predicted for them, but they did reach the Finals in four consecutive seasons, an NBA feat we haven&#x2019;t seen in three decades, and no amount of 2014-level disappointment or summertime intrigue about their future can take away their two championship rings. 
 San Antonio? The franchise is back where it belongs, at the top of the NBA&#x2019;s figurative heap, doing past Spurs legends from David Robinson to Bruce Bowen to Jaren Jackson to Avery Johnson to Speedy Claxton proud as they shared the ball and embraced role players while putting each other in a position to both create and succeed. Tired sportswriter-isms about &#x201C;playing the right way&#x201D; or valuing the team above all are usually and rightfully responded to with appropriate eye rolls, but this Spurs team was an absolute pleasure to take in. 
 In the end, maybe it is OK to be angry at the Miami Heat for the way they finished their attempt at a championship defense. In losing in just five games, they denied us a chance to watch the San Antonio Spurs play basketball for another two games. 
 Someone should have to pay for that. At least we have five years&#x2019; worth of championship performances to rewind and re-watch.
