				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Booking your favourite band for a private function may not cost as much as you once thought, though it&#8217;s still almost certainly way more than you can afford. The important thing is we know, thanks to a newly leaked document.</p>
<p>Compiled by the good guys over at <a href="http://priceonomics.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-book-your-favorite-band/">Priceonomics</a>, the list contains plenty of surprises. To book <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/Justin-Bieber/">Bieber</a> you&#8217;ll need more than $1 million, but to book <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/one-direction/">One Direction</a>, you&#8217;ll just need $150k &#8211; $200k. Which is, what, just one BMW M5? Nothing. </p>
<p><a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/madonna/">Madonna</a>, <strong>Dave Matthews</strong> and <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/bruce-springsteen/">Bruce Springsteen</a> are some of the other artists who make up the $1 Million or more club, which isn&#8217;t all that surprising. </p>
<p>Things have clearly gotten tough in camp <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/matchbox-twenty/">Matchbox Twenty</a>. The seminal &#8217;90s outfit can be rented for a measly $150k a sesh. And <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/fall-out-boy/">Fall Out Boy</a>, talk about a bargain! They can be booked for just $100k. </p>
<p>As for Aussies, well, we&#8217;re few and far between on the list, it&#8217;s sad to say. Bag Raiders, Ben Lee and Anna Lunoe will all set you back under $10k, whereas Tame Impala get an open-ended $10k or more.</p>
<p>An unknown source from <strong>Degy Entertainment</strong> leaked the list, which also features discount artists you can nab for between $1k to $10k. But we&#8217;ll give you a hint, they aren&#8217;t the artists you&#8217;re looking for. </p>
<p>Check out the full list <a href="http://priceonomics.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-book-your-favorite-band/">right here.</a>  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="getty-embed"><iframe width="640" scrolling="no" height="473" frameborder="0" style="display:inline-block;" src="//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/486403121?et=lrg9Y-BQTdt4r7st4aFBCQ&#038;sig=MzxowhPjp608RZn3sXBJDoQHIRtCVxnnU1kTQkkXjfk="></iframe></div>
<p>The &#8220;greatest&#8221; singer in popular music is one of those pub debates that starts off as a friendly disagreement and soon metastasises into people being written out of wills, fisticuffs, and divorce, but the folks at Concert Hotels have decided to do something to ease all the needless familial strife.</p>
<p>While their <a href="http://www.concerthotels.com/worlds-greatest-vocal-ranges" target="_blank">new interactive chart</a> certainly won&#8217;t settle who the &#8220;greatest&#8221; singer in music is, the singer with the largest vocal range is in fact <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/guns-n-roses/" target="_blank">Guns N&#8217; Roses</a> frontman <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/axl-rose/" target="_blank">Axl Rose</a>, who is able to deftly command a staggering five octaves. To qualify, the current world record holder has a range of 10.</p>
<p>Rose&#8217;s range puts him in good company, helming a top five that includes <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/mariah-carey/" target="_blank">Mariah Carey</a>, a former Guinness World Record-holder for largest vocal range, <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/prince/" target="_blank">Prince</a>, <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/aerosmith/" target="_blank">Aerosmith</a> frontman <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/steven-tyler/" target="_blank">Steven Tyler</a>, and the King of Soul <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/james-brown/" target="_blank">James Brown</a>. When things start to get even more interesting is at the bottom.</p>
<p>Coming in last is Country singer <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/luke-bryan/" target="_blank">Luke Bryan</a>, who has the smallest range of those tallied, but joining him are superstars like <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a> and <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/taylor-swift/" target="_blank">Taylor Swift</a>, and even popular music legends like <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/sam-cooke/" target="_blank">Sam Cooke</a> and <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/karen-carpenter/" target="_blank">Karen Carpenter</a>. In fact, Cooke and Bieber possess almost identical vocal ranges.</p>
<p>Concert Hotels have also ranked the highest lowest notes that the artists have been able to hit, with Carey topping the highest list and Axl actually beating out <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/barry-white/" target="_blank">Barry White</a> to top the lowest notes list. It is of course important to note that the list was tallied according to each artist&#8217;s studio output and is thus a representation of what notes the artist was able to hit and not necessarily sing regularly.</p>
<p>Some interesting tidbits from the list (via <a href="http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/05/axl-rose-is-the-greatest-singer-of-all-time-or-so-says-this-chart/" target="_blank"><em>Consequence of Sound</em></a>) include gravelly-voiced street poet <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/tom-waits/" target="_blank">Tom Waits</a> bearing a larger range than <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/bjork/" target="_blank">Bjork</a> and <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/stevie-nicks/" target="_blank">Stevie Nicks</a>, <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/lorde/" target="_blank">Lorde</a> possessing a larger range than <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/whitney-houston/" target="_blank">Whitney Houston</a>, and <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/kurt-cobain/" target="_blank">Kurt Cobain</a> and <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/miley-cyrus/" target="_blank">Miley Cyrus</a> both beating out icon <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/aretha-franklin/" target="_blank">Aretha Franklin</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On paper, it might have&#8230; No. This is the worst idea ever. Why this unfortunate clump of plastic faced, musically ambitious celebrity &#8220;lookalikes&#8221; &#8211; a <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a>, a <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/Madonna/">Madonna</a> and a <strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong> &#8211; followed through and formed a band called The Plastics, to make music about the wonders of plastic surgery, is well and truly beyond us.</p>
<p>Remember <strong>Toby Sheldon</strong>, the overly enthusiastic young man who <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/33-year-old-drops-100k-on-surgery-to-look-like-justin-bieber-still-doesnt/">spent a wad of cash</a> to look like a melted <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a>? Well, he&#8217;s got some new best pals. </p>
<p>Squint the right way and <strong>Venus D&#8217;Lite</strong>, of Ru Paul&#8217;s <em>Drag Race</em> fame, is a dead ringer for a <strong>Madonna</strong> impersonator who hasn&#8217;t had a shit ton of work done. <strong>Kitty Jay</strong> dropped 25 Gs to sculpt herself into nothing like <strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong>. Round up club douche <strong>Adam Barta</strong> for your beats. Presto &#8211; insta pop group!</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right &#8211; it took <em>multiple</em> talents to get this one across the line. </p>
<p>When you enter the world of The Plastics, nothing is real. Not the pitch, not the facial structures. The track itself and the hastily cobbled together video are also recognisable as poor imitations of popular concepts. All the culture trappings are there, minus the dignity, self awareness or talent. Even the auto-tune seems fake. Go figure.</p>
<p>The zombie squad now have a press agent and management team, as well as real-life, honest-to-god, trained medical professionals ready to dedicate their time to soulless steamers like these. You&#8217;re all fucked.</p>
<p><strong>Watch: Toby Sheldon, Venus D&#8217;Lite and Kitty Jay &#8211; <em>The Plastics</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some readers may recall the <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/justin-bieber-incites-black-keys-backlash/" target="_blank">2013 Twitter skirmish</a> between <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/the-black-keys/" target="_blank">Black Keys</a> drummer <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/patrick-carney/" target="_blank">Patrick Carney</a> and teen pop idol <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a>, which erupted after Carney made some rather harmless comments outside of the Chateau Marmont and subsequently faced the collective wrath of Justin&#8217;s Beliebers.</p>
<p>In February 2013, <em>TMZ</em> asked Carney if Bieber should&#8217;ve felt snubbed by not scoring a <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/grammys-2014/" target="_blank">Grammy</a> nom. Carney responded by telling the cameraman that &#8220;Grammys are for music, not for the money, and he&#8217;s making a lot of money. He should be happy.&#8221; Bieber responded by tweeting, &#8220;The Black Keys drummer should be slapped around haha,&#8221; which his followers took as a call to arms.</p>
<p>A few million death threats later, Carney tells <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/black-keys-patrick-carney-unleashes-fresh-batch-of-justin-bieber-hate-20140509" target="_blank"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a> that the singer&#8217;s behaviour is part of a continuing cycle of irresponsibility and hypocrisy. &#8220;Justin Bieber, like a fucking irresponsible asshole, sicced 40 million Twitter followers on me because I paid him a compliment he didn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m saying that he should be grateful that he has a fucking career in music,&#8221; Carney explains. &#8220;And he shouldn&#8217;t be fucking telling his followers to slap me, and then also be doing anti-bullying bullshit. It&#8217;s so irresponsible.&#8221; Carney added that Bieber&#8217;s followers are misguided and even manipulated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just started getting called a faggot, you know? All these kids who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re saying are saying all of these things that are actually wildly inappropriate. And these kids are just dumbasses,&#8221; the drummer continues. &#8220;I mean, Justin Bieber is a fucking moron. And that&#8217;s the gist of what I was saying. And then he goes and says I should be slapped? Honestly, I feel bad for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every single person who works with him should fucking be embarrassed that they don&#8217;t&#8230; No one is doing him any favours, you know? And honestly, I don&#8217;t dislike his music. I don&#8217;t listen to his music.&#8221; Carney adds that Bieber should feel grateful for making millions of dollars from a music career.</p>
<p>Delving into the more disturbing aspects of Bieber&#8217;s fandom, he says, &#8220;You go on Justin Bieber&#8217;s Twitter account like a total pervert every time that he gets in trouble, you should look at his tweets the next day. It&#8217;s always like, &#8216;I love you guys so much, always believe, never stop believing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s feeding them the Kool-Aid more and more,&#8221; Carney says of Bieber&#8217;s tweets. &#8220;He pours it on heavy, though. It&#8217;s so manipulative! And whoever taught him that that was OK, whoever&#8217;s watching him and is like &#8216;that manipulation is acceptable,&#8217; should be really ashamed of themselves.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Untruthful White House officials are certainly nothing new, but White House spokesmen insisting the President of the United States would review a petition organised to see the deportation of Canadian pop singer <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a> and then reneging certainly is, and that&#8217;s what appears to have happened.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/white-house-to-address-justin-bieber-deportation-petition/" target="_blank">previous assurances</a> from White House spokesman <strong>Jay Carney</strong> that President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> would look over <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/deport-justin-bieber-and-revoke-his-green-card/ST1yqHJL" target="_blank">the petition</a> once it crosses the 100,000-signature threshold necessary to prompt review by the POTUS, a <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/believing-immigration-reform" target="_blank">statement released on the White House website</a> says different.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to disappoint, but we won’t be commenting on this one,&#8221; it reads. According to the statement, the White House will not address &#8216;Deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card&#8217; as it may result in &#8220;the appearance of improper influence,&#8221; which would be out of character for the US government.</p>
<p>However, the statement commends organisers and signees on their proactive attitude and apparent interest in immigration reform, using Bieber sales numbers to illustrate how reform would be a boon to the US economy and saying that they&#8217;ll &#8220;leave it to others to comment on Mr. Bieber’s case.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6062690/justin-biebers-deportation-petition-receives-no-comment-from-white-house" target="_blank"><em>Billboard</em></a> reports, while anyone can agree with the petition&#8217;s terms that Bieber is &#8220;dangerous, reckless, destructive, and drug abusing&#8221; and &#8220;a terrible influence on our nation&#8217;s youth,&#8221; the singer&#8217;s O-1 visa can only be revoked upon conviction of a violent crime or a one-year prison sentence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only natural to liken real-life figures to characters and archetypes in popular works of fiction, whether comparing your math teacher to Nurse Ratched or that homeless guy to Willy Wonka. But <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/game-of-thrones/" target="_blank"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> actress <strong>Sophie Turner</strong> recently linked two figures that may as well be brothers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only 13 [when I joined <em>Game of Thrones</em>]. I was one of those girls that read <em>OK!</em> twelve times a week, and I was all ‘Ooh, <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a>’— who is the <strong>Joffrey Baratheon</strong> of our time,&#8221; Turner, who plays Stansa Stark on the hit fantasy show (<a href="http://screenfeeds.com.au/tv/new-game-of-thrones-season-4-trailer-unveiled/" target="_blank">see Season 4 trailer here</a>), told the <a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/article1389051.ece" target="_blank"><em>Sunday Times</em></a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, Turner is not the first to make such an obvious comparison. In fact, as <a href="http://www.pedestrian.tv/news/entertainment/sansa-stark-justin-bieber-is-the-joffrey-baratheon/c8ca0f02-bb31-47ac-b9af-a3b415b4e433.htm" target="_blank"><em>Pedestrian.tv</em></a> point out, the Tumblr blog <a href="http://joffreybieber.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><em>Joffrey Bieber</em></a> exists for the sole reason of allowing &#8220;fiction&#8217;s biggest brat and real life&#8217;s biggest brat [to] become one,&#8221; and we gotta say, the results are pretty hilarious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the recent release of the <em>Veronica Mars</em> movie, it&#8217;s about time Hollywood started crowdsourcing their ideas and not just their budgets. Well it&#8217;s about to happen, with a triumvirate of <strong>Jon M Chu</strong>, <strong>Jason Blum</strong>, and <strong>Scooter Braun</strong> announcing their plans for a <em>Jem and the Holograms</em> movie.</p>
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with <em>Jem and the Holograms</em>, it was an animated series that ran from 1985 to 1988, chronicling the adventures of a music executive named Jerrica Benton, who used her earrings to transform into the mysterious frontwoman of <em>The Holograms</em>. It was the &#8217;80s, y&#8217;know?</p>
<p>Jon M Chu, best known as the director of <em>Step Up 2</em>, Jason Blum, the producer behind the <em>Paranormal Activity</em> franchise, and Scooter Braun, the man who gave us <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a> (inspiring combo, we know), are looking to bring the series into the world of live action and the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Despite the tragic trio behind the feature, the production concept is novel and could prove a boon for the project. The three have starred in a YouTube video in which they ask fans to send in videos explaining what they like about <em>Jem</em>, as well as audition clips from potential cast members.</p>
<p>And as <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/jason-blum-scooter-braun-prods-jon-chu-team-with-hasbro-on-jem-and-the-holograms/" target="_blank"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports, the plot seems to come right from the heart of the 21st Century zeitgeist. While the original series was set in the pre-Napster, pre-iPod world of the 1980s record industry, the film will inhabit a universe in which labels have been replaced by the web:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Mixing music, art, technology, and fairytale, &#8216;Jem And The Holograms&#8217; reimagines Jem for a whole new generation with themes of being true to who you are in a multitasking, hyperlinked social-media age.</p>
<p>&#8220;When an orphaned teenage girl becomes an online recording sensation, she and her sisters embark on a music-driven scavenger hunt – one that sends them on an adventure across Los Angeles in an attempt to unlock a final message left by her father.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Readers can check out Chu, Blum, and Braun&#8217;s announcement vid below. Production is set to begin this autumn, with Chu directing from a script penned by <strong>Ryan Landels</strong>, whose previous credits appear to be mostly TV-movies and a series called <em>The LXD: The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a> has yet again been winning friends and influencing people, with gossip website <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/03/10/justin-bieber-videotaped-deposition-video-selena-gomez-usher/">TMZ</a> today unveiling the highlights of the 20-year-old pop star&#8217;s deposition video, in which he attempts to win gold in the Smuggest Prat Of 2014 category.</p>
<p>Bieber was questioned for four hours on 6 March, pertaining to an incident from last June, in which a paparazzo claims the singer instructed his bodyguard to beat him up. The <em>Boyfriend</em> singer displays a whole lot of &#8216;tude in the video, with highlights including storming out of the room when asked about <strong>Selena Gomez</strong> and being unable to recall whether he&#8217;s ever visited Australia or not.</p>
<p>While Bieber hasn&#8217;t commented directly on the leaked videos, he has gotten a touch passive aggressive <a href="https://twitter.com/justinbieber">on Twitter overnight</a>, tweeting &#8220;Love how some people love to twist and justify the horrible action of others. We all have a right to defend ourselves and feel harassed&#8221; followed by &#8220;They can&#8217;t break us. They can&#8217;t get us down. We are too strong. We love too much. #mybeliebers&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just the latest incident in <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/white-house-to-address-justin-bieber-deportation-petition/">a long line of turbulent behaviour</a> from the young Canadian, who is under investigation for allegedly egging a neighbour’s house in Los Angeles, as well as turning himself into Toronto Police for the alleged assault of a limo driver.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Besides <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/men-at-works-colin-hay-writes-open-letter-to-justin-bieber/" target="_blank">prompting Men At Work frontman Colin Hay to pen stern, fatherly letter</a>, <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a>&#8216;s recent legal misconduct led many to sign a <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/deport-justin-bieber-and-revoke-his-green-card/ST1yqHJL" target="_blank">White House petition calling for Bieber&#8217;s deportation back to Canada</a> and it now looks like the voice of the people will finally be heard.</p>
<p>During a press conference on Friday, White House spokesman <strong>Jay Carney</strong> was asked whether US President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> would review the &#8220;We the People&#8221; petition, which at the time of Hay&#8217;s open letter had already garnered 8000 signatures, and presently sits at just over 238,000 signatures.</p>
<p>&#8220;That process will occur, as is our commitment,&#8221; said Carney, as reported by <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/today-jay-carney-addressed-justin-bieber-at-the-wh-press-briefing/" target="_blank"><em>Mediaite</em></a>. According to <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/how-why/terms-participation" target="_blank">the White House website</a>, after reaching 150 signatures within 30 days, &#8220;a petition must reach 100,000 signatures within 30 days&#8221; to cross the second threshold and see a response.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a response when the threshold is crossed. That response will come, I’m sure, relatively soon. I don’t have one now on matters related to visas. I would refer you to DHS,&#8221; added Carney, though the 100,000 signature threshold had in fact already been crossed at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We the people of the United States feel that we are being wrongly represented in the world of pop culture,&#8221; reads the petition created on 23rd January. &#8220;We would like to see the dangerous, reckless, destructive, and drug abusing, Justin Bieber deported and his green card revoked,&#8221; it continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not only threatening the safety of our people but he is also a terrible influence on our nations youth. We the people would like to remove Justin Bieber from our society.&#8221; Bieber is currently facing arraignment on charges of drunk driving, resisting arrest, and driving with an expired license.</p>
<p>Bieber was already under investigation for allegedly egging a neighbour’s house in Los Angeles, which led to a police search of his home. Meanwhile, Bieber recently turned himself into Toronto Police for the alleged assault of a limo driver, though his lawyer contends the claims are untrue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following in the somewhat ill-advised footsteps of <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/sinead-oconnor/" target="_blank">Sinead O&#8217;Connor</a> and subsequently <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/amanda-palmer/" target="_blank">Amanda Palmer</a>, former <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/men-at-work/" target="_blank">Men At Work</a> frontman <strong>Colin Hay</strong> has penned an open letter to troubled pop star <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/feeds/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a>, following his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol and marijuana.</p>
<p>According to the missive, posted to his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ColinHayMusic/posts/780030512026782?stream_ref=10" target="_blank">official Facebook page</a>, Hay penned the cautioning note while preparing for a show. &#8220;It would seem that your antics of late have caused comments from many, and predictably, those with the least amount of talent, lash with the harshest tongues,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>Echoing sentiments expressed in <a href="http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/sinead-oconnor-and-miley-cyrus-beef-heats-up/" target="_blank">O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s letter to Miley Cyrus</a>, Hay warns Bieber of the distraction and corrupting influence of fame, drawing parallels between his own career and Bieber&#8217;s, writing, &#8220;We were kings for a couple of years. It was explosive. When the dust settled, I was alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know you, but I care about you&#8230;and in the end we all cry for our mama,&#8221; adds Hay. &#8220;The person holding your diet coke and slice of pizza is not necessarily your friend, and when your entourage shrinks, whether by design or circumstance, be glad, and just breathe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hay goes on to advise Bieber that &#8220;only in creative endeavor and service to others, do we receive by default, some salvation,&#8221; adding, &#8220;We know you can sing, dance, and apparently are quite handy with a spray can. But, we haven&#8217;t really heard you speak. Only time will tell if you have something to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the DUI charge, Bieber, released on a $2861.56 bond, faces charges of resisting arrest and driving with an expired Georgia state licence. News of the singer&#8217;s most recent brush with the law has seen immigration lawyers warning Bieber that his conduct could see him kicked out of the US.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/men-at-works-colin-hay-pens-open-letter-to-justin-bieber-20140125-31f0i.html" target="_blank"><em>Fairfax</em></a> reports, Bieber was already under investigation for allegedly egging a neighbour&#8217;s house in Los Angeles, which led to police searching his home. By Friday afternoon, an <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/deport-justin-bieber-and-revoke-his-green-card/ST1yqHJL" target="_blank">online petition on the official White House website</a> calling for Bieber&#8217;s deportation had amassed 8000 signatures.</p>
<p><strong>Colin Hay&#8217;s Open Letter To Justin Bieber</strong></p>
<p><em>Dear Mr. Bieber,<br />
I am using you as a distraction, I have a show tonight, and I should be practising my pentatonics. I will, in a minute. It would seem that your antics of late have caused comments from many, and predictably, those with the least amount of talent, lash with the harshest tongues. It happens. Your kind of success has always been precarious. In the early 80s, I had monumental commercial success with my old band Men At Work, and although time and circumstances were different, some parallels can be drawn. Our first album &#8220;Business As Usual&#8221; sold over 10 million copies, was number 1 on the Billboard charts for 16 weeks, until Michael Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Thriller&#8221; knocked us off. Good company indeed. We were kings for a couple of years. It was explosive. When the dust settled, I was alone. I looked around and everyone had left the party. My acoustic guitar was sitting in the corner, and luckily for me, it waited patiently till I eventually picked it up. For only in creative endeavor and service to others, do we receive by default, some salvation. Nothing else is important, everything else is distraction, like this note to you. But I felt compelled to write to you, albeit indirectly. I don&#8217;t know you, but I care about you, as you are a little one, like all of us, and in the end we all cry for our mama. The person holding your diet coke and slice of pizza is not necessarily your friend, and when your entourage shrinks, whether by design or circumstance, be glad, and just breathe. We know you can sing, dance, and apparently are quite handy with a spray can. But, we haven&#8217;t really heard you speak. Only time will tell if you have something to say.<br />
Colin</em></p>
