<p>Up to this point in the &#8220;Why Dallas?&#8221; series, we&#8217;ve covered both the advantages <a href="http://www.mavs.com/why-dallas-part-1-cultivating-winning-culture/" target="_blank">the Mavs&#8217; organizational culture</a> and <a href="http://www.mavs.com/why-dallas-part-2-man-clipboard/" target="_blank">the team&#8217;s head coach</a>, Rick Carlisle, could provide to prospective draft choices and free agents.</p>
<p>But as with all teams in the NBA, organization attractiveness depends not just on the culture, and not just on the head coach, but also on the other men who sit on the bench during the games. Every head coach leans on his assistants and the rest of his staff throughout the season for countless reasons. Assistants have a hand in developing offensive and defensive strategies, scouting current and future opponents, and even tracking very specific stats during and after games &#8212; more than just minutes and fouls.</p>
<p>Carlisle has earned a reputation as one of the best head coaches in the NBA, <a href="http://www.mavs.com/rick-carlisles-coaching-tree-growing-strong/">and two members of his coaching tree</a>, Dwane Casey and Terry Stotts, both led teams to the playoffs this year and finished in the top-10 in Coach of the Year voting. Both of Carlisle&#8217;s current top assistants, Monte Mathis and Kaleb Canales, are coaches held in high regard. Mathis engineers the defense and prepares players for games with thorough scouting reports, while Canales &#8212; one of the youngest active coaches with head coaching experience &#8212; heads up the offense.</p>
<p>But Casey Smith, the team&#8217;s head trainer, might be the Mavs&#8217; secret weapon.</p>
<p><div class="mavs-gallery alignright"><h2>Casey Smith</h2><div class="gallery-left"><p>View photos of Mavs athletic trainer Casey Smith</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.mavs.com/game-night/photo-galleries/casey-smith-photo-gallery/">View Gallery</a></li><li><a href="http://www.mavs.com/game-night/photo-galleries/">View More Galleries</a></li></ul></div><div class="gallery-right"><a href="http://www.mavs.com/game-night/photo-galleries/casey-smith-photo-gallery/"><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://static.mavs.com/wp-content/uploads/cache/2014/06/85611113_10-001/3213939377.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Casey Smith Photo Gallery"></a></div><div class="clear"></div></div>For several years, Dallas has been among the oldest teams in the league, but at the same time the Mavericks have for the most part managed to stay healthy through it all. There have certainly been injuries, but based on the number of minutes veterans like Dirk Nowitzki, Shawn Marion, Vince Carter, and even Jason Kidd play or played during their time in Dallas, it&#8217;s difficult to argue against Smith&#8217;s ability. It&#8217;s no wonder, then, that he was Team USA&#8217;s athletic trainer for the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, as well as the 2010 FIBA World Championship.</p>
<p>On that 2010 team, which won the gold medal, was Tyson Chandler. The big man spent just one season in Dallas, but played 74 games after suffering through multiple injury-plagued seasons in New Orleans and Charlotte during the years prior. Until the &#8217;10-11 season, he&#8217;d only played more than 74 games in a season once since 2004-05. But Smith and the Mavs training team kept him healthy during the regular season and playoffs, and as we&#8217;d learn in June 2011, it&#8217;s a good thing Chandler stayed off the injured list. Dallas doesn&#8217;t win the title that season without Chandler, but there&#8217;s no guarantee Tyson could have remained healthy without Casey Smith.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, NBA training staffs mean a great deal. Smith himself hails from the Phoenix Suns program, which was for a long time considered one of the best in the league. Clearly, Smith brought some knowledge with him to Dallas, where the Mavericks have successfully extended the careers of veterans while also extending the prime of younger players. Monta Ellis drove to the lane more often than any other player in the league this season, and he didn&#8217;t miss a game. Yes, that says a lot about Monta&#8217;s own toughness, but it also speaks volumes about Smith and the rest of the staff.</p>
<p>For aging veterans and young players alike, a team&#8217;s injury history and current training staff are both definitely considered as part of the equation, as is the rest of the coaching staff underneath a team&#8217;s head boss. In both areas, Dallas is at or near the very top of the list. The Mavs&#8217; pitches to potential free agents and their attractiveness to draft prospects can be so versatile; Donnie Nelson, Mark Cuban, and the rest of the Mavs brass can push whatever they want to whoever they want. At every level throughout the front office &#8212; and let&#8217;s not forget about the stuff that happens <em>on </em>the floor, either &#8211; Dallas is a quality organization.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The San Antonio Spurs put on three consecutive clinics en route to the franchise's fifth championship since 1999, playing the best basketball we've seen in a while along the way.

But the lingering thought among Mavs fans — and many others, for that matter — is how were the Mavericks able to contain San Antonio for so long? Dallas, after all, beat the Spurs three times during the teams' first-round matchup, including once in San Antonio, one of only two times the Spurs lost at home all postseason. After Game 7 of the first round, the Spurs rattled off 12 wins against just four losses, winning every game in convincing fashion. That was not the case against Dallas, a team who fought valiantly and could have very well won the series. So how'd it happen?

Two main theories have prevailed. The first is that San Antonio was sleepwalking through its first-round matchup until Dallas took a 2-1 series advantage on Vince Carter's buzzer-beating three-pointer to win Game 3. But that argument objectively and subjectively makes no sense. The reasoning goes that many of San Antonio's main rotation players were almost <em>too</em> rested heading into the playoffs and it took them a few games to get back into the swing of things. However, that wasn't the case last season, or the season before, or the season before, or during any season in which San Antonio has been one of the top seeds in the West heading into the playoffs. Head coach Gregg Popovich is too good a motivator to allow complacency from his team.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mavs.com/how-dirk-and-the-mavs-gave-the-spurs-their-toughest-test/">How Dirk and the Mavs gave the Spurs their toughest test</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mavs.com">The Official Site of the Dallas Mavericks</a>.</p>]]></description>

<p><div class="mavs-gallery alignright"><h2>Mavs vs. Spurs</h2><div class="gallery-left"><p>View photos of the Mavs&#8217; 109-108 win over the Spurs</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.mavs.com/game-night/photo-galleries/mavs-vs-spurs-game-3-apr-26-2014/">View Gallery</a></li><li><a href="http://www.mavs.com/game-night/photo-galleries/">View More Galleries</a></li></ul></div><div class="gallery-right"><a href="http://www.mavs.com/game-night/photo-galleries/mavs-vs-spurs-game-3-apr-26-2014/"><img itemprop="contentUrl" src="http://static.mavs.com/wp-content/uploads/cache/2014/06/486891979_10/874151875.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Mavs vs. Spurs Game 3 Apr. 26, 2014"></a></div><div class="clear"></div></div>What&#8217;s more, Carter&#8217;s buzzer-beater didn&#8217;t signal an immediate change in San Antonio&#8217;s demeanor. The Mavs led in the fourth quarter in Game 4 and, were it not for DeJuan Blair&#8217;s ejection, Dallas realistically could have won the game. Meanwhile, in Game 5, Dirk Nowitzki put on an offensive blitzkrieg in the fourth quarter to bring the Mavericks back into what was at one point a relative blowout, and the Spurs only ended up winning by just six points. Dallas then turned around and won Game 6 at home. Game 7 is when the Spurs found the groove that carried them to the championship, but to even argue that it took San Antonio six games to &#8220;wake up&#8221; is to discredit not only the Mavericks, but also the Spurs. No team at any level of basketball is going to push itself to the edge of elimination before finally finding itself.</p>
<p>That leaves the other theory: Dallas gave San Antonio its toughest test because Mavs head coach Rick Carlisle is Popovich&#8217;s most dangerous coaching adversary. Carlisle was able to counter most every move Popovich made through the first six games of the series before the Spurs finally prevailed in seven at home. This belief is far more fair to Dallas, as it doesn&#8217;t completely dismiss the team from the conversation. However, even simply pointing to Carlisle alone isn&#8217;t enough to explain how the Mavericks were able to give the Spurs their toughest challenge. Though Carlisle definitely and rightfully earned a heap of praise for the job he and his staff did against San Antonio, the Dallas roster had a lot to do with that, as well.</p>
<p>In terms of matchups, Dallas turned out to be the type of team that gave the Spurs fits, especially on the offensive end. The Mavericks as a team posted a 106.8 offensive rating against San Antonio, meaning the Mavs scored 106.8 points per 100 possessions in the series. For the rest of the playoffs, including against two efficient offensive juggernauts in Portland and Miami, San Antonio allowed just 98.6 points per 100 — a mark that would have led the league this season.</p>
<p>The Spurs are known to build defensive gameplans around taking an opponent&#8217;s best offensive option away, but Dallas proved that the strategy doesn&#8217;t exactly work against a team like the Mavericks. For starters, it&#8217;s a challenge to limit both Monta Ellis <em>and</em> Dirk Nowitzki. The Spurs relied on Tim Duncan&#8217;s rim protection to slow Ellis down at the rim, and Popovich leaned on Tiago Splitter to face off against Nowitzki on the perimeter. The plan worked in that Nowitzki shot below his season average and Ellis often opted to take jump shots, but other Mavericks around them each enjoyed moments where they thrived. Sticking to tightly to Nowitzki on the perimeter left the rest of the team able to play 4-on-4 basketball on the other side of the court. Blair, for example, had a field day inside as Duncan often left him to worry about the driving Ellis. The Spurs threw their best defenders at Monta, leaving Devin Harris or Jose Calderon against San Antonio&#8217;s weaker guard. You can&#8217;t stress enough the importance Nowitzki&#8217;s presence alone had on San Antonio&#8217;s gameplan. The German forced Popovich to play Splitter heavy minutes, when later in the playoffs he was supplanted in the starting lineup by Boris Diaw. Splitter is a fine player, but Diaw fits in better alongside Duncan, as the French forward can stretch the floor as a three-point threat and also possesses a superior ability to pass the ball both from the perimeter and the interior. Splitter&#8217;s offensive presence by itself took away one more three-point shooter for the Spurs, which played right into the Mavs&#8217; gameplan.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, Vince Carter and Calderon each presented their own set of problems to the Spurs, because both of them can drive the lane and create for others. Harris and Ellis can do the same, and even Blair and Nowitzki have very nice inside passing games. No other team San Antonio faced during the playoffs had so many different creators offensively. Portland relied on the driving ability of Damian Lillard and the isolation work of LaMarcus Aldridge, but that alone won&#8217;t beat the Spurs. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook did their best to dissect the Spurs&#8217; solid defense, but even they couldn&#8217;t crack the code by themselves. And as we saw in the Finals, LeBron James often scored at will, but he was the only Miami player who could manage to break down the defensive wall along the perimeter. Dallas, however, often had three or even four players on the court at once who could snake their way toward the rim, and in today&#8217;s NBA that opens up all sorts of opportunities on the wing for open shots. The Mavs were easily the most versatile offensive team San Antonio had to face.</p>
<p>Ball-handling ability aside, the Mavericks bench was also an enormous thorn in the Spurs&#8217; side. San Antonio&#8217;s reserves are considered to be the best second unit in the league. Led by Manu Ginobili, that bunch deserves the praise it&#8217;s drawn. But the Dallas bench simply outplayed the Spurs&#8217; in the series. The four Mavericks with the best on-floor point differential in the series were all reserves: Blair, Jae Crowder, Carter, and Brandan Wright. Meanwhile, San Antonio&#8217;s Patty Mills, Boris Diaw, and Marco Belinelli — all key players off the bench who each saw more than 90 minutes of playing time in the series — finished with a negative on-floor net rating. (Against the Spurs&#8217; three other playoff opponents, only one player finished with an on-floor net rating of less than +9.7, which is simply remarkable.) If the Spurs had the deepest roster this year, a strong case could be made that the 2013-14 Mavs were the second-deepest. The Dallas bench not only kept the team in games, but that group won them contests. Blair&#8217;s energy was key in Games 4 and 6, and Carter&#8217;s buzzer-beater will live on for years to come. Harris, meanwhile, put up 11.4 points and 4 dimes a game, strong numbers for any reserve.</p>
<p>For as much criticism as the Mavericks defense drew during the playoffs, Dallas was able to limit the Spurs attack better than any other opponent. The Spurs scored 110.2 points per 100 possessions against the Mavericks, but that number inflated to higher than 113 against Portland, Oklahoma City, and Miami. Carlisle and the Mavs organized a defense that would take away the Spurs&#8217; complementary players, including Danny Green, Belinelli, Mills, Diaw, and others, in favor of allowing Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili into pick-and-rolls with Tim Duncan and Splitter. Miami&#8217;s mistake in the Finals was trying to remove Parker from the equation by attacking the Spurs&#8217; pick-and-roll sets, which often resulted in sharp ball movement that led to open three-pointers. (The Mavericks beat Miami in 2011 by doing similar things offensively.) That Kawhi Leonard (who won it) and Diaw were among candidates for the Finals MVP award shows just how far the Heat&#8217;s plan backfired. Dallas, meanwhile, concentrated on the peripheral players and instead forced the Spurs to run entirely through Parker and Ginobili. In this case, it&#8217;s easier to see why San Antonio couldn&#8217;t have just &#8220;woken up&#8221; after Game 3, 6, or any other contest in the Mavs/Spurs series. Dallas defended San Antonio completely differently than its other opponents.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one lengthy explanation of why Dallas was able to give San Antonio fits that no other team could repeat. The Mavericks had a unique roster this season, made up of versatile, smart players who could execute solid gameplans to a tee. There&#8217;s no telling how far the Mavericks could have gone in the playoffs had Game 7 or any of the other first-round losses gone the opposite way, but if San Antonio&#8217;s sprint to the Finals following the first-round matchup is any indication, it&#8217;s safe to say that maybe, just maybe, the Mavs weren&#8217;t as far from a nice postseason run as you might think. It&#8217;s obviously silly to say the Mavs would have won the title, as after one round there&#8217;s still <em>a lot</em> of basketball to play, but Dallas had the star power and supporting cast that head coaches crave, and it also had the coach that talent longs to play for.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s certainly no such thing as a moral victory, but the Mavericks gave the NBA champs their toughest fight, and that does mean something: This year&#8217;s club was one of the best in the league.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>They were the only team to push the eventual NBA champion San Antonio Spurs during this year's playoffs, but the Dallas Mavericks take no satisfaction in moral victories.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DALLAS &#8212; They were the only team to push the eventual NBA champion San Antonio Spurs during this year&#8217;s playoffs, but the Dallas Mavericks take no satisfaction in moral victories.</p>
<p>Capturing a 2-1 first-round series lead after sixth man Vince Carter’s game-winning 3-pointer as time expired in Game 3 to lift Dallas to a 109-108 victory, the Mavericks would go down as the only team to take a series advantage on the Spurs this postseason. The Mavs would also push the Spurs to the brink of elimination while forcing a decisive Game 7.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">And although they didn&#8217;t leave the court simply satisfied with their effort after falling to a 119-86 defeat in the crucial seventh showdown, the eighth-seeded Mavs still had plenty of reasons to hold their heads up high.</span></p>
<p>“I like what we did,” 12-time All-Star Dirk Nowitzki said. “I like what we did to get into the playoffs; to battle, the excitement we showed and the fight we showed. I definitely like that. And I like the fight we showed for the first six games (against the Spurs), giving them nothing easy, making them work for everything and sweat it out at least until Game 7. But Game 7 was a tough one. That’s for sure.”</p>
<p>“Everyone counted us out from Day 1 to even get here, and [Game 7] felt like a championship game,” new addition Monta Ellis added. “It was a great experience and everybody was on board. I’m very proud of what we did and what we overcame. We came together as a team and took the best team in the NBA to a dogfight all the way to the end.”</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The Spurs went 12-4 through the rest of the playoffs while storming through Portland, Oklahoma City and the two-time defending champion Miami Heat en route to the title. But it&#8217;s the Mavericks that put up the most </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">resistance</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> of the four teams as the Southwest Division rivalry was renewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Bringing together nine new faces during training camp, the Mavericks seemed to jell at the right time while showing that they could compete against the league&#8217;s best team. Still, the Mavs acknowledge that they fell short in their pursuit of a second title in franchise history. And three years removed from hoisting the Larry O&#8217;Brien </span>trophy<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> above their heads for the first time, the Mavericks enter the offseason with plans to build on their year&#8217;s shortcomings.</span></p>
<p>“I think you’re always disappointed when the season ends. It doesn’t matter when,” Mavs point guard Jose Calderon confessed. “It was tough. You always try to be positive about everything. … Nobody maybe gave us a chance to be in the playoffs. Nobody gave us [a chance] to get to seven games, so that’s the positive part. I think we’re close to being a really good team. I think we’re pretty close and we showed that in this series. We just need to play a little bit better and stay together, but at the end of the day we showed that we’re right there to compete against everybody in this league and to be a really good team.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/mpghftk70d?videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="640" height="360"></iframe><script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/iframe-api-v1.js"></script></p>
<p>When Monta Ellis signed a three-year deal with the Mavericks last summer, one of the first things he did was meet with Rick Carlisle. Ellis didn&#8217;t find the Mavs head coach in Dallas. Instead, he found him in Houston.</p>
<p>Ellis, the new Maverick who&#8217;d faced plenty of criticism during his final years in Golden State and Milwaukee &#8212; especially toward his jump shot &#8212; was anxious to improve his game, to return to the All-Star-caliber level he played at earlier in his career. Carlisle was there for him from the get go.</p>
<p>So the two worked in Houston, not far from Ellis&#8217;s summer home, the pair working to hone the mechanical aspects of Ellis&#8217;s game. Ellis didn&#8217;t want to hear about his much-maligned shot selection, and Carlisle didn&#8217;t want to give any lectures. They worked at the little things. Several months later, as Ellis single-handedly blew open a fourth-quarter lead against the San Antonio Spurs in Game 6 of the playoffs, it appeared as if the partnership paid off.</p>
<p>Carlisle is regarded as one of the best coaches in the game. He&#8217;s a head boss without a real weakness. Tactically, he&#8217;s maybe the best &#8212; no team is better out of a timeout and the Dallas offense is unstoppable. When it comes to motivation, there&#8217;s no argument against the Mavericks&#8217; belief they could beat the potential champion Spurs this postseason. The Mavs embrace analytics as much as just about any other franchise in the league. As for player development? The results speak for themselves. Why would a star <em>not</em> want to play for him?</p>
<p>Carlisle&#8217;s own commitment to Ellis&#8217;s return to stardom is far from rare during the coach&#8217;s time in Dallas. Carlisle spent similar time with then-Maverick OJ Mayo two summers ago, but unfortunately Mayo wasn&#8217;t able to sustain his hot start to the 2012-13 campaign for the entire season. With Ellis, the end result was just the opposite. He kept improving throughout the entire season, to the point where not only was he perhaps the most important player on the team, but he also led the whole team in three-point shooting from the corner. The player who supposedly couldn&#8217;t shoot turned out to be the best from the corner on a team full of sharpshooters.</p>
<p>The same could be said for other players viewed almost as reclamation projects when they came to Dallas. Vince Carter, for example, was an aging wing who was supposedly well past his prime. But during the past two seasons, the case could be made that he&#8217;s been the best reserve in the NBA. Jason Kidd was the point guard who couldn&#8217;t guard point guards, so Carlisle assigned him to guard shooting guards and small forwards, and he did so at a high level. Brandan Wright, who battled injury earlier in his career, is now regarded as one of the most efficient players in the sport. Dirk Nowitzki was the star who couldn&#8217;t defend, so Carlisle and Dwane Casey engineered a zone defense that won the Mavericks a championship.</p>
<p>Carlisle shouldn&#8217;t get <em>all</em> of the credit. Players have to be willing to change as well — whether it means taking less shots, playing fewer minutes, or sacrificing some other element of their own game. The organization-wide culture also plays a part in that, as the Mavs only sign players who have a desire to fit into the establishment. But the case could be made that more than any member of the organization, Rick Carlisle is the most attractive Dallas asset. Whether he works with a player like Nowitzki, who has sustained excellence for years, or heavily criticized players like Ellis, Carlisle has the ability and know-how to make players fit into his system while also taking their talents to the next level. For players who want to win a championship, there&#8217;s no quality in a coach that&#8217;s more important.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DALLAS &#8212; It was admittedly the Dallas Mavericks&#8217; weakness this season. But, with hopes of keeping this year&#8217;s team intact, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle can envision the defensive side of the ball becoming Dallas&#8217; calling card going forward.</p>
<p>Excelling as an offensive juggernaut during the 2013-14 season, the Mavericks ranked eighth in the NBA in points scored while putting up 104.8 an outing. The Mavs also dished out 23.6 assists a game, which was good for sixth as a team.</p>
<p>But it was the defensive side of the ball that would often let the Mavs down, ranking 20th in the league while allowing 102.4 points a contest and 22nd with a 108.7 defensive rating.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a bunch of individual stoppers,&#8221; Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle confessed during the season. &#8220;We’ve got [Shawn] Marion, who to me is perennial all-defense, even though he never gets it. And we’ve got [Samuel] Dalembert, who is one of the best rim protectors. Then, on the rest of the team there’s no guys on paper that you’d say is an NBA stopper. We have to do it by showing a crowd, bringing a lot of help and by being really tied together.”</p>
<p>With Marion often guarding the best perimeter scorer for the other team and Dalembert looking to anchor the back line, the Mavericks tried to make up for the deficiencies of the Dallas defense. However, while often getting broken down off dribble penetration, the Mavs would struggle to keep teams from feasting in the painted area.</p>
<p>Entering training camp with nine new faces via the draft and free agency, the Mavs would go on to allow opposing teams to shoot 46.4 percent from the field and 35.9 percent from behind the three-point arc this season, which ranked 22nd and 15th in the league, respectively. Dallas also allowed teams to collect 11.5 offensive rebounds a game, finishing 24th in that department while failing to string together defensive stops.</p>
<p>Still, the Mavericks acknowledge that there&#8217;s room for improvement, vowing to recommit to the defensive side of the ball next season.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to continue to take pride in defense, keep guys in front of us and do a better job, starting with me and with all of us,” Dalembert said. “You know, we just have to do a better job. It’s not just specific people, it’s all of us as a group and as a team. We can score. I mean, we can see that we can score, but we’ve got to start holding opponents.”</p>
<p>However, with two of their better perimeter defenders set to enter free agency on July 1, the Mavs could have a much different look next season.</p>
<p>Hoping to re-sign Marion for his versatility and ability to defend multiple positions, the Mavericks&#8217; brass will certainly make it a priority to meet with the 15-year veteran as soon as free agency begins. The same could be said for reserve guard Devin Harris, who stepped up on the defensive end in the Mavs&#8217; second unit after battling back from offseason toe surgery.</p>
<p>And according to Carlisle, with less upheaval of the roster, the Mavs are fully capable of becoming a better defensive team next season.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, defensively, we&#8217;ll be better next year,&#8221; the coach explained. &#8220;You know, again, I thought nine new guys was a challenging thing. The way Dalembert finished the season the last two months was really encouraging for next year, and yes, that&#8217;s another reason why Marion is important. And I think if we can get Devin Harris back next year and have him from start to finish, he&#8217;s one of our better defenders as well. So, we&#8217;ll keep working in that area and it will be a priority for us.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tomorrow&#8217;s Stars Take Center Stage At Samsung NBA Summer League</strong></p>
<p>NEW YORK, June 12, 2014 – The New York Knicks and Dallas Mavericks will tip off Samsung NBA Summer League on July 11 at 1 p.m. PT in the first of 67 games to be contested over the course of the 11-day event at the Thomas &#038; Mack Center and COX Pavilion on the campus of the University of Nevada Las Vegas.</p>
<p>NBA TV’s coverage of the Samsung NBA Summer League will begin in COX Pavilion on July 11 with a four-game slate. The network will televise all 67 games, including a total of 38 games live during the event, including the Championship Game on July 21.  In addition, fans will again be able to watch, via a subscription-based package, every Samsung NBA Summer League game live at http://nba.com/summerleague and on the NBA Summer League app.  A complete broadcast schedule is below.</p>
<p>The reigning summer league champion Golden State Warriors, who recently hired Steve Kerr as their head coach, will begin the quest to defend their title on opening day in a 5:30 p.m. PT tilt against the Charlotte Hornets at the Thomas &#038; Mack Center.  The Warriors won the inaugural NBA Summer League Championship in 2013, defeating the Phoenix Suns 91-77 in the title game.  The Hornets are coming off their first trip to the playoffs since 2010 and own the ninth overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft presented by State Farm. </p>
<p>The first day of games will also feature a 5 p.m. contest in COX Pavilion between the Cleveland Cavaliers, who own the first overall selection in the 2014 NBA Draft presented by State Farm, and the Milwaukee Bucks, who will make the second pick in the draft.  Top prospects this year include Australia’s Dante Exum, Duke’s Jabari Parker, Indiana’s Noah Vonleh, Kansas’s Joel Embiid and Andrew Wiggins, and Kentucky’s Julius Randle.  </p>
<p>The Utah Jazz makes its Samsung NBA Summer League debut on Saturday, July 12, when the team faces the Philadelphia 76ers at 7:30 p.m. PT at the Thomas &#038; Mack Center.  The Jazz recently hired Quin Snyder as its new coach and owns the fifth overall pick in this year’s NBA Draft.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s brightest stars often get their start at Samsung NBA Summer League, with seven of the last nine Kia NBA Rookie of the Year Award winners having taken part in action in Las Vegas.  Two years removed from his MVP turn at NBA Summer League in 2012, Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers was recently named to the All-NBA Third Team.  NBA Summer League success is not always reserved for high first-round picks, with the New York Knicks’ Tim Hardaway Jr., the 24th overall pick of the 2013 NBA Draft, turning a strong showing in Las Vegas last summer into a spot on the 2013-14 NBA All-Rookie First Team.</p>
<p>For the second consecutive year, the event will feature a tournament-style schedule, culminating in the crowning of the Samsung NBA Summer League 2014 Champion on Monday, July 21.  Each of the participating teams will play three games apiece between July 11 and 15 before being seeded in the tournament, which tips off on July 16 and runs through the Championship Game on July 21.  Each team will play no fewer than five games during Samsung NBA Summer League 2014. </p>
<p>Samsung, the official handset, tablet, and television provider of the NBA, Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), and NBA Development League (NBA D-League), joins as the title partner of NBA Summer League for the first time this summer.<br />
Tickets for Samsung NBA Summer League are on sale now.  Fans can purchase tickets by visiting NBATickets.com, or by calling 702-739-FANS.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DALLAS &#8212; It was the birth of a new dynamic duo in the NBA this season in Dallas as the Mavericks paired 12-time All-Star Dirk Nowitzki with new addition Monta Ellis.</p>
<p>Looking to add a potent scorer on the perimeter to assist Nowitzki at the offensive end of the floor, the Mavericks&#8217; front office inked Ellis to a multi-year contract last summer during free agency. The two then quickly formed one of the most lethal scoring tandems in the league, highlighted by the Mavs&#8217; come-from-behind 123-120 home win over Houston on Nov. 20 when Ellis posted a season-high 37 points on 13-of-18 shooting and Nowitzki added 35 points on 13-of-20 from the field.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">“If me and Dirk are going like that, you know, the other teams have a problem,” Ellis said after the Mavs overcame an 18-point deficit in the third quarter to capture the win. “And not just because we’re going like that, but because that means they’re going to pay so much attention to us that it opens it up for Vince [Carter], Jose [Calderon], Shawn [Marion] and guys like that.”</span></p>
<p>“Look, they’re both stars in this league,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle added in regard to his 1-2 scoring punch. “In big games and big moments your stars have got to be stars, and they were. You know, we had a good balance of them playing off of each other and them getting other people involved. And they’ve got to do a lot of work at both ends, &#8217;cause teams are trying to attack them. It’s a lot of work, but we’ve done some good things and we’ve got to keep riding the wave here.”</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">However, in an era where superstars are aligning across the league, do the Mavs need the emergence of a third go-to scorer to get them back to a championship level? </span></p>
<p>With Nowitzki and Ellis shouldering most of the offensive burden, the Mavericks returned to the playoffs for a 13th time in the last 14 seasons following a 49-33 campaign. Perhaps more importantly, the Mavs also relied on their depth as five scorers averaged in double figures during the regular season.</p>
<p>Led by Nowitzki, who averaged a team-best 21.7 points per game this season, and Ellis&#8217; 19.0 points an outing, the Mavs saw a drop-off to Carter&#8217;s 11.9 points off the bench. But the shared scoring responsibilities didn&#8217;t seem to slow down the Mavs&#8217; offense at all. And after ranking eighth in the league while putting up 104.8 points a game as a team, the Mavericks more than made up for not having a third go-to scorer.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">“We have a lot of scoring on this team and a lot of guys who can do a lot of things,&#8221; Carter foreshadowed </span>heading into the season.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> &#8221;With the amount of scorers we have and the guys that can do a lot of things, we believe in each other. I think everybody has bought in from the beginning on sharing the ball, and you’re starting to see that. That mentality in the very beginning of the season is going to carry us through the rest of the year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That was certainly the case.</p>
<p>Pushing the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs to seven games in the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks continued to rely on Nowitzki and Ellis while adding additional scoring down the roster. But, with the Spurs&#8217; Big Three of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili eventually having their way, the Mavs would find themselves on the losing end of a competitive series.</p>
<p>Still, the Mavericks believe that they&#8217;re built for success as they attempt to take another step forward next season, looking to continue to rely on their depth as they pursue a second championship in franchise history.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve got a team that knows how to play basketball,” Calderon confidently said. “There’s other teams that just rely on good players, but I think we can be a really good basketball team. And when we play as a team, it’s going to be easier to get to where we want to be.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>As the league season inches toward free agency season, now less than three short weeks away, the Mavericks are sitting pretty as one of the few teams in the league with significant salary cap space. What they choose to do with this money will inevitably affect the team's outlook not just for next season, but also the seasons beyond.

Mavs fans will remember that the team has been in a similar position heading into each of the past two offseasons. Following both the 2011-12 and 2012-13 campaigns, Dallas had enough money to sign big-name free agents to max-level contracts. However, the Mavs weren't able to land the big fish they sought after, but that ultimately turned out to work in the team's advantage.

During the two offseasons prior to this one, Dallas found itself in vastly different situations than the one it is in now. Following the lockout-shortened '11-12 campaign, the Mavericks chose to sign several players to one-year contracts after Deron Williams signed with the Brooklyn Nets, including among others OJ Mayo and Chris Kaman. Dallas also traded for Darren Collison, who, like Mayo, Kaman, and many other Mavericks, had just one year remaining on his contract.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mavs.com/why-dallas-part-1-cultivating-winning-culture/">Why Dallas?

What they choose to do with this money will inevitably affect the team&#8217;s outlook not just for next season, but also the seasons beyond.</p>

However, the Mavs weren&#8217;t able to land the big fish they sought after, but that ultimately turned out to work in the team&#8217;s advantage.</p>
<p>During the two offseasons prior to this one, Dallas found itself in vastly different situations than the one it is in now. Following the lockout-shortened &#8217;11-12 campaign, the Mavericks chose to sign several players to one-year contracts after Deron Williams signed with the Brooklyn Nets, including among others OJ Mayo and Chris Kaman. Dallas also traded for Darren Collison, who, like Mayo, Kaman, and many other Mavericks, had just one year remaining on his contract.</p>
<p>The roster on paper was a good one, and despite Nowitkzi&#8217;s nagging knee injury that sidelined him for a third of the 2012-13 season, Dallas was unable to gel the way it did this season. Combined with Nowitzki&#8217;s injury, that team&#8217;s foundation, built on players on one-year deals, never had the chance to grow together as a single unit.</p>
<p>That was the exact problem the Mavs addressed last season, when the team signed Monta Ellis and Jose Calderon to long-term contracts. The Mavs&#8217; backcourt will be together at least through next season, and an option on Ellis&#8217; deal could keep him here for 2015-16 as well. Sam Dalembert and Wayne Ellington, two other free agent acquisitions last season, were both signed to multi-year deals as well. Dallas opted to build a veteran team that would have the time and know-how to come together, and that&#8217;s exactly what happened. Nowitzki was healthy as ever this past season, and the new-look Mavericks stormed through the finish line, ending 2013-14 with 49 wins, the club&#8217;s most since 2010-11.</p>
<p>That leads us to this summer, when Dallas will have roughly $30 million in cap space. But unlike the past two summers, this year the Mavs aren&#8217;t looking to revamp an entire roster. Dallas has built a new foundation based on players with multi-year contracts who are committed to staying with this team. As has been reported on Mavs.com during the past few weeks, Dallas <em>does</em> have several key free agents this summer, including Nowitzki, Shawn Marion, and Vince Carter. Each of those players, as well as free-agent-to-be Devin Harris, has said they&#8217;d like to remain here. Clearly, Dallas is on to something.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s new culture grew almost organically during the &#8217;13-14 season. Nine new players were added to the mix last summer, but they came together rather quickly, and by year&#8217;s end it seemed every player in the locker room was happy in Dallas. That alone could attract potential free agents this summer, but more importantly, the long-term deals the Mavs offered last summer could be the team&#8217;s best asset moving forward.</p>
<p>By signing players like Calderon and Ellis to multi-year deals, as well as one-year veterans Shane Larkin, Ricky Ledo, and Gal Mekel (all of whom can remain under the Mavs&#8217; control for three more seasons), Dallas showed that it was willing to commit to its backcourt. The front office has faith in each of those players. That matters to free agents, who would much rather sign a three- or four-year deal than ink a one-season contract. At the same time, free agents are also less willing to sign with a team with a cloudy future. That certainly isn&#8217;t a problem for the Mavericks, whose immediate future is not at all unclear. Western Conference champion San Antonio could attest to that. Calderon and Ellis, among other Mavericks, are under contract for multiple years into the future, signaling to free agents that an already very sturdy group will remain intact.</p>
<p>Add to that mix Nowitzki, who immediately after the season practically guaranteed he&#8217;d re-sign with the team, and all of a sudden the Mavs&#8217; core, combined with the team&#8217;s ample cap space, makes Dallas one of the most attractive landing spots for any free agent this summer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DALLAS &#8212; It was an up-and-down second season for Dallas Mavericks forward Jae Crowder, but the former Marquette standout now enters the summer with plenty to build upon.</p>
<p>Playing in 78 outings for the second straight season, the 6-foot-6 Crowder would see his number of starts cut in half after finding himself in the first unit 16 times during his rookie campaign. He also saw his production slightly dip from Year 1 to Year 2 while going from 17.3 minutes per game as a rookie to 16.1 minutes an outing this season.</p>
<p>But, after boosting his shooting percentage from 38.4 percent in his first year to 43.9 percent this season, Crowder felt like he gained the confidence of his teammates while making strides on the offensive side of the ball.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">“It’s just a mindset. I don’t know when I’m going to get my shot (in the games), but when it comes I have to step into it aggressively and take them,&#8221; Crowder said during the season. &#8220;I know I can shoot the ball and my teammates have faith in me, so I just have to step in and shoot.”</span></p>
<p>Committed to bettering his outside shooting after connecting on just 32.8 percent from three-point range as a rookie, Crowder worked tirelessly last summer to find a better rhythm behind the arc. Known for his defensive prowess while often relieving veteran Shawn Marion and guarding the opposition&#8217;s best perimeter stars, Crowder looked to develop into more of a two-way player during his second season. The 34th pick in the 2012 NBA Draft then came out the gates firing on all cylinders to start the season, following up a career-high 18-point outing on Nov. 5 against the Los Angeles Lakers with 17 points the next night against the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">“I just stayed in the gym and worked on my shot,&#8221; the 23-year-old Crowder explained. &#8221;I knew I wasn’t a 32-percent three-point shooter.  In the offseason, I spent a lot of time in the gym and really worked on my shot. I have a lot of confidence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">He added: </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">“I came into camp knowing I had to improve on my outside shooting and be more consistent. To get minutes on this team I need to be able to stretch the floor, and that’s what I’ve been trying to work on and that’s what the coaches have been working me with and trying to get better every day.”</span></p>
<p>However, by season&#8217;s end Crowder would once again find himself in a slump, finishing the year shooting just 33.1 percent from long range.</p>
<p>After briefly falling out of Mavs coach Rick Carlisle&#8217;s rotation, Crowder regained  his confidence during a brief stint with the team&#8217;s Development League affiliate, the Texas Legends. Crowder immediately dominated with the Legends, recording consecutive triple-doubles and a combined 55 points, 32 rebounds and 20 assists in two appearances. However, despite connecting on 44.4 percent from the field and 42.9 percent from three-point range during Dallas&#8217; first-round playoff series in seven games against the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs, Crowder played just a minimal role for the Mavericks and averaged only 2.7 points and 1.7 assists in his 11.6 minutes of work off the bench.</p>
<p>Still, Carlisle says he saw gradual improvements in Crowder&#8217;s game that figures to benefit the team next season.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">“You know, I think Crowder is going to keep getting better. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">… And you’ve got to have a system where younger guys are getting better</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">,” Carlisle said. </span></p>
<p>With both Marion and sixth man Vince Carter set to enter free agency on July 1, the Mavericks may need to call on Crowder even more so next season at the small forward spot. With that said, Crowder showed that he can handle a larger role, playing a career-high 40 minutes and registering 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting during a 107-90 road win at New Orleans on Jan. 10.</p>
<p>But consistency is what Crowder will search for before heading into his third season, looking to become a more reliable contributor for the Mavs going forward.</p>
<p>“It’s a dream come true to play in the NBA,&#8221; Crowder modestly said. &#8220;I really stamped my NBA mark here and I can go up from here. I just need to keep working hard, let the moment last and get ready to come back and play hard.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to play for the Mavericks and to put on this uniform. You’re playing for those guys in the locker room and the organization. It’s a great feeling. I just want to give it my all every day.”</p>
